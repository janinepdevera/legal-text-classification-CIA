# Semantic Similarity for Multi-Label Text Classification: Application to Legal Text for CIA

Healthy market competition benefits business and consumers by ensuring access to goods and services of the best possible price and quality. Promoting well-functioning markets requires a whole of government approach to ensure that laws and regulations governing different industries do not restrict competition in the course of achieving their policy objectives. As such, policy makers and antitrust authorities conduct Competition Impact Assessment (CIA) studies to comprehensively review various legislations and evaluate potentially restrictive provisions. These studies help identify and ultimately address conflicts between sector objectives and antitrust laws but often require significant time and manpower. 

The goal of this research is to develop a pre-screening tool for authorities who regularly conduct CIAs. Automatic labeling of legal text and tagging of potentially restrictive provisions can be the first step of the rigorous process. 

State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models are trained, validated, and tested using a corpus of more than 5,000 pieces of legislation from 5 sample countries.
