0,A,A,"Limiting the number of suppliers leads to the risk that market power will be created and competitive rivalry will be reduced. When the number of suppliers declines, the possibility of diminished competition (or collusion) among remaining suppliers increases, and the ability of individual suppliers to raise prices can be increased. The resulting decline in rivalry can reduce incentives to meet consumer demands effectively and can reduce innovation and long-term economic efficiency. While there may be sound reasons for policy makers to limit the number or range of suppliers the benefits of entry limits need to be carefully balanced against the fact that ease of entry by new suppliers can help prevent existing suppliers from exercising market power or colluding.",118,limit the number of supplier lead to the risk that market power will be creat and competit rivalri will be reduc when the number of supplier declin the possibl of diminish competit or collus among remain supplier increas and the abil of individu supplier to rais price can be increas the result declin in rivalri can reduc incent to meet consum demand effect and can reduc innov and long-term econom effici while there may be sound reason for polici maker to limit the number or rang of supplier the benefit of entri limit need to be care balanc against the fact that ea of entri by new supplier can help prevent exist supplier from exercis market power or collud
1,A,A1,"Granting an exclusive right to produce a certain good, or provide a certain service, represents the establishment of a private monopoly. Historically, the grant of an exclusive right occurred frequently in the context of a ‚Äúnatural monopoly‚Äù.s Exclusive rights, particularly if granted for a long duration, have frequently been considered as a means of encouraging substantial investment in infrastructure that might not occur without the incentive of a guaranteed market that an exclusive right provides. But exclusive rights are sometimes used in situations where the natural monopoly justification for them does not apply. Exclusive rights are, in many respects, the ultimate entry barrier and are likely to yield monopoly pricing and other problems associated with the exercise of market power. Regulation does not always prevent these outcomes because regulators often fail (or have limited success) in the restriction of market power and protection of consumers. Therefore, such rights should be limited and only established after careful consideration of prices to be charged, duration of rights, and alternative ways to achieve the same objectives.",172,grant an exclus right to produc a certain good or provid a certain servic repres the establish of a privat monopoli histor the grant of an exclus right occur frequent in the context of a ‚äúnatur monopoly‚äù. exclus right particularli if grant for a long durat have frequent been consid a a mean of encourag substanti invest in infrastructur that might not occur without the incent of a guarante market that an exclus right provid but exclus right are sometim use in situat where the natur monopoli justif for them doe not appli exclus right are in mani respect the ultim entri barrier and are like to yield monopoli price and other problem associ with the exercis of market power regul doe not alway prevent these outcom becaus regul often fail or have limit success in the restrict of market power and protect of consum therefor such right should be limit and onli establish after care consider of price to be charg durat of right and altern way to achiev the same object
2,A,A2,"Licenses or permits required for operation necessarily restrict entry. Qualification requirements can take the form of minimum standards for formal education and/or experience and may include good character requirements. For example, in the finance industry, before participation in an official capacity at company and board level is permitted, so-called ‚Äúfit-and-proper‚Äù tests are often required. In other industries, potential entrants are sometimes required to take a test to demonstrate the need for an additional service to be provided and, in some cases, to show that their entry would not have a negative impact on existing industry businesses. In extreme cases, there may be a fixed numbers of licensees. License or permit requirements are often stricter than needed for consumer protection and can reduce consumer choice unnecessarily or create artificial scarcity that raises prices. While licensing schemes often have well- founded consumer protection objectives, such barriers frequently have the effect of protecting incumbent producers from competition.

For example, some governments require all real estate brokers to provide a government-mandated set of services, which limits or prohibits low-cost minimum-service brokers, or fee-for-service brokers, from providing services.

4,A,A4,"Regulations that raise the cost of entry to, or exit from, a market will tend to discourage potential entrants thus reducing the number of participants in the market over time. Examples of this type of regulation include: rigorous product testing requirements, and unnecessarily high educational or technical qualifications to be met. In the case of the digital economy, physical presence, minimum scale and inspection rules can unduly obstruct entry. Governments sometimes act to minimise the negative competitive impacts of such provisions by providing targeted exemptions. For example, low-volume car manufacturers are often exempt from aspects of vehicle testing regulations, or subject to less onerous testing protocols. To enable better informed consumer choices, alternatives such as providing more information or product disclosure requirements could be considered. In some cases, regulation may be required, even though it could raise entry costs.

5,A,A5,"Regulations sometimes limit the flow of goods, services, capital and/or labour across jurisdictional boundaries, often as an instrument of regional policy. Such limitations, however, artificially reduce the geographic area of competition for provision of a good or service. This may reduce the number of suppliers and potentially allow suppliers to exercise market power and increase prices. Potential restrictions should be assessed on the following questions: Is there a clear link between the restrictions and achievement of specific policy goals?; Are restrictions the minimum necessary for achievement of the goal?; Does a reasoned analysis suggest that the policy goal will be achieved by means of the restriction?; Are restrictions limited to a finite time span through explicit regulatory provisions?

7,B,B1,"Governments often regulate prices in traditional monopoly sectors, such as utilities. These types of price control are probably helpful to consumers and serve as a counterweight to a lack of consumer alternatives. However, price controls are also sometimes applied in situations where there are many potential suppliers for the same consumer. When minimum prices are set, low-cost suppliers who provide better value to consumers are prevented from winning market share. Similarly, when maximum prices are set, supplier incentives to innovate by providing new and/or high-quality products can be substantially reduced, and suppliers may effectively co-ordinate their prices around the maximum price. Minimum price regulation is sometimes a response to extremely vigorous price competition. In these cases, minimum price regulation is generally seen as a means of protecting small suppliers from ‚Äúunfair‚Äù competition. The impacts of such price regulation merit careful evaluation because the result is likely to be higher prices for consumers or unmet demand. Maximum price regulations are frequently introduced as a necessary corollary to entry restrictions.

8,B,B2,"Regulations that restrict supplier's ability to advertise or market goods and services often exist to limit false or misleading advertising. Sometimes restrictions are intended to reduce advertising for products or services that are deemed to have a socially negative value or that are subject to excess consumption. At other times, advertising to certain vulnerable  groups, such as children, may be restricted. Restrictions of this nature, when circumscribed to ensure they are not overly broad, can have significant social benefits. In many cases, however, advertising and marketing restrictions are too broad and unduly restrict competition. Restrictions on advertising and marketing are likely to be particularly onerous for potential entrants, as they restrict an entrant‚Äôs ability to inform potential customers of their presence in the market and of the nature and quality of the goods and services that they are able to offer.",140,regul that restrict supplier 's abil to advertis or market good and servic often exist to limit fals or mislead advertis sometim restrict are intend to reduc advertis for product or servic that are deem to have a social neg valu or that are subject to excess consumpt at other time advertis to certain vulner group such a child may be restrict restrict of thi natur when circumscrib to ensur they are not overli broad can have signific social benefit in mani case howev advertis and market restrict are too broad and unduli restrict competit restrict on advertis and market are like to be particularli oner for potenti entrant a they restrict an entrant‚äô abil to inform potenti custom of their presenc in the market and of the natur and qualiti of the good and servic that they are abl to offer
9,B,B3,"Regulations setting standards often provide benefits to consumers and can help to promote new types of products by ensuring that new products from different suppliers are compatible. But standard setting can also provide undue advantages to some suppliers over others. One common example is environmental regulations that limit the allowable emissions of a mildly toxic substance. While limiting emissions is often appropriate to protect public health, regulations can be designed in ways that unfairly advantage a small number of suppliers, for instance, by requiring a particular technology or by setting unduly strict standards that are difficult, or impossible, for less well- resourced producers to meet. Another example where standard-setting can have asignificant anti-competitive impact is when minimum quality standards are set for particular product types. There are often sound objectives underlying such standard-setting, such as consumer protection from risks associated with the use of the product. However, when some consumers prefer lower cost over increased safety, the need for the standard is less clear. Consumer welfare can be reduced by such standards as consumers are prevented from buying cheaper, lower quality goods that they might prefer, even when fully informed of all associated risks.",193,regul set standard often provid benefit to consum and can help to promot new type of product by ensur that new product from differ supplier are compat but standard set can also provid undu advantag to some supplier over other one common exampl is environment regul that limit the allow emiss of a mildli toxic substanc while limit emiss is often appropri to protect public health regul can be design in way that unfairli advantag a small number of supplier for instanc by requir a particular technolog or by set unduli strict standard that are difficult or imposs for le well- resourc produc to meet anoth exampl where standard-set can have asignific anti-competit impact is when minimum qualiti standard are set for particular product type there are often sound object underli such standard-set such a consum protect from risk associ with the use of the product howev when some consum prefer lower cost over increas safeti the need for the standard is le clear consum welfar can be reduc by such standard a consum are prevent from buy cheaper lower qualiti good that they might prefer even when fulli inform of all associ risk
10,B,B4,"At times, regulations have the effect of raising costs for some suppliers relative to others. One source of cost asymmetry is due to regulations that unnecessarily require the use of one technology of production over another. Another source is the grandfather clause which exempts current suppliers from a regulation but applies it to new entrants. Subsidies or preferential financing for state-owned or preferred enterprises are also a source. Imposition of regulations which were designed for traditional suppliers on digital technology powered businesses may increase their costs. Such arrangements have substantial potential to distort competitive relations within the industry by influencing costs to some suppliers to a greater extent than to others. This can create inefficiency, impede entry, reduce corporate- led innovation and lower the intensity of competitive pressure in the market. While creating cost differentials can be harmful, this does not mean that regulations should always seek uniform supplier costs. Regulations that require registration to practice a particular profession can include grandfather clauses to allow those who have extensive experience within the profession to be registered even if they do not have the training or qualifications necessary for new applications to register. In relation to productive technologies, grandfather clauses are often implemented to ensure adequate time exists to amortise the sunk costs of previous investments.

11,C,C,"Regulations can affect supplier behaviour by not only changing their ability to compete, but also by changing their incentive to act as vigorous rivals. The main reasons suppliers may compete less vigorously are due to regulations that: may facilitate co-ordination between them or reduce the willingness, ability or incentive of customers to switch between different suppliers. Other reasons include profit or market share limits, that restrict potential rewards from competing. Cartel-like behaviour may be more readily generated under self-regulatory or co-regulatory regimes, by increasing the share of supplier output and price information, or by excluding an industry or sector from the reach of competition law. Cartels are harmful because they restrict output and raise prices, making consumers worse off.
