0,A,A,"Limiting the number of suppliers leads to the risk that market power will be created and competitive rivalry will be reduced. When the number of suppliers declines, the possibility of diminished competition (or collusion) among remaining suppliers increases, and the ability of individual suppliers to raise prices can be increased. The resulting decline in rivalry can reduce incentives to meet consumer demands effectively and can reduce innovation and long-term economic efficiency. While there may be sound reasons for policy makers to limit the number or range of suppliers the benefits of entry limits need to be carefully balanced against the fact that ease of entry by new suppliers can help prevent existing suppliers from exercising market power or colluding.",118,limit number supplier lead risk market power creat competit rivalri reduc when number supplier declin possibl diminish competit collus among remain supplier increas abil individu supplier rais price increas the result declin rivalri reduc incent meet consum demand effect reduc innov long-term econom effici while may sound reason polici maker limit number rang supplier benefit entri limit need care balanc fact ea entri new supplier help prevent exist supplier exercis market power collud
1,A,A1,"Granting an exclusive right to produce a certain good, or provide a certain service, represents the establishment of a private monopoly. Historically, the grant of an exclusive right occurred frequently in the context of a ‚Äúnatural monopoly‚Äù.s Exclusive rights, particularly if granted for a long duration, have frequently been considered as a means of encouraging substantial investment in infrastructure that might not occur without the incentive of a guaranteed market that an exclusive right provides. But exclusive rights are sometimes used in situations where the natural monopoly justification for them does not apply. Exclusive rights are, in many respects, the ultimate entry barrier and are likely to yield monopoly pricing and other problems associated with the exercise of market power. Regulation does not always prevent these outcomes because regulators often fail (or have limited success) in the restriction of market power and protection of consumers. Therefore, such rights should be limited and only established after careful consideration of prices to be charged, duration of rights, and alternative ways to achieve the same objectives.",172,grant exclus right produc certain good provid certain servic repres establish privat monopoli histor grant exclus right occur frequent context ‚äúnatur monopoly‚äù. exclus right particularli grant long durat frequent consid mean encourag substanti invest infrastructur might occur without incent guarante market exclus right provid but exclus right sometim use situat natur monopoli justif appli exclus right mani respect ultim entri barrier like yield monopoli price problem associ exercis market power regul alway prevent outcom regul often fail limit success restrict market power protect consum therefor right limit establish care consider price charg durat right altern way achiev object
2,A,A2,"Licenses or permits required for operation necessarily restrict entry. Qualification requirements can take the form of minimum standards for formal education and/or experience and may include good character requirements. For example, in the finance industry, before participation in an official capacity at company and board level is permitted, so-called ‚Äúfit-and-proper‚Äù tests are often required. In other industries, potential entrants are sometimes required to take a test to demonstrate the need for an additional service to be provided and, in some cases, to show that their entry would not have a negative impact on existing industry businesses. In extreme cases, there may be a fixed numbers of licensees. License or permit requirements are often stricter than needed for consumer protection and can reduce consumer choice unnecessarily or create artificial scarcity that raises prices. While licensing schemes often have well- founded consumer protection objectives, such barriers frequently have the effect of protecting incumbent producers from competition. Care needs to be taken that license and permit requirements do not become more onerous than necessary to achieve the desired regulatory objectives.",176,licens permit requir oper necessarili restrict entri qualif requir take form minimum standard formal educ and/or experi may includ good charact requir for exampl financ industri particip offici capac compani board level permit so-cal ‚äúfit-and-proper‚äù test often requir in industri potenti entrant sometim requir take test demonstr need addit servic provid case show entri would neg impact exist industri busi in extrem case may fix number license licens permit requir often stricter need consum protect reduc consum choic unnecessarili creat artifici scarciti rais price while licens scheme often well- found consum protect object barrier frequent effect protect incumb produc competit care need taken licens permit requir becom oner necessari achiev desir regulatori object
3,A,A3,"Governments can limit the ability of certain suppliers to participate in a business activity. For example, some governments require all real estate brokers to provide a government-mandated set of services, which limits or prohibits low-cost minimum-service brokers, or fee-for-service brokers, from providing services. Such restrictions are often excessive because they unduly restrict the number of suppliers, reduce competition between suppliers and result in higher prices or less desirable contract terms for customers.",71,govern limit abil certain supplier particip busi activ for exampl govern requir real estat broker provid government-mand set servic limit prohibit low-cost minimum-servic broker fee-for-servic broker provid servic such restrict often excess unduli restrict number supplier reduc competit supplier result higher price le desir contract term custom
4,A,A4,"Regulations that raise the cost of entry to, or exit from, a market will tend to discourage potential entrants thus reducing the number of participants in the market over time. Examples of this type of regulation include: rigorous product testing requirements, and unnecessarily high educational or technical qualifications to be met. In the case of the digital economy, physical presence, minimum scale and inspection rules can unduly obstruct entry. Governments sometimes act to minimise the negative competitive impacts of such provisions by providing targeted exemptions. For example, low-volume car manufacturers are often exempt from aspects of vehicle testing regulations, or subject to less onerous testing protocols. To enable better informed consumer choices, alternatives such as providing more information or product disclosure requirements could be considered. In some cases, regulation may be required, even though it could raise entry costs. The focus should be on minimising anti-competitive potential by ensuring that",149,regul rais cost entri exit market tend discourag potenti entrant thu reduc number particip market time exampl type regul includ rigor product test requir unnecessarili high educ technic qualif met in case digit economi physic presenc minimum scale inspect rule unduli obstruct entri govern sometim act minimis neg competit impact provis provid target exempt for exampl low-volum car manufactur often exempt aspect vehicl test regul subject le oner test protocol to enabl better inform consum choic altern provid inform product disclosur requir could consid in case regul may requir even though could rais entri cost the focu minimis anti-competit potenti ensur
5,A,A5,"Regulations sometimes limit the flow of goods, services, capital and/or labour across jurisdictional boundaries, often as an instrument of regional policy. Such limitations, however, artificially reduce the geographic area of competition for provision of a good or service. This may reduce the number of suppliers and potentially allow suppliers to exercise market power and increase prices. Potential restrictions should be assessed on the following questions: Is there a clear link between the restrictions and achievement of specific policy goals?; Are restrictions the minimum necessary for achievement of the goal?; Does a reasoned analysis suggest that the policy goal will be achieved by means of the restriction?; Are restrictions limited to a finite time span through explicit regulatory provisions? There is a substantial risk of ‚Äútemporary‚Äù protection developing into a quasi-permanent arrangement as a result of substantial lobbying by suppliers benefitting from the restrictions.",142,regul sometim limit flow good servic capit and/or labour across jurisdict boundari often instrument region polici such limit howev artifici reduc geograph area competit provis good servic thi may reduc number supplier potenti allow supplier exercis market power increas price potenti restrict ass follow question is clear link restrict achiev specif polici goal are restrict minimum necessari achiev goal doe reason analysi suggest polici goal achiev mean restrict are restrict limit finit time span explicit regulatori provis there substanti risk ‚äútemporary‚äù protect develop quasi-perman arrang result substanti lobbi supplier benefit restrict
6,B,B,"Regulation can affect a supplier's ability to compete in a variety of ways, including: advertising and marketing restrictions; standard setting for products or service quality; and price control of goods or services.

7,B,B1,"Governments often regulate prices in traditional monopoly sectors, such as utilities. These types of price control are probably helpful to consumers and serve as a counterweight to a lack of consumer alternatives. However, price controls are also sometimes applied in situations where there are many potential suppliers for the same consumer. When minimum prices are set, low-cost suppliers who provide better value to consumers are prevented from winning market share. Similarly, when maximum prices are set, supplier incentives to innovate by providing new and/or high-quality products can be substantially reduced, and suppliers may effectively co-ordinate their prices around the maximum price. Minimum price regulation is sometimes a response to extremely vigorous price competition. In these cases, minimum price regulation is generally seen as a means of protecting small suppliers from ‚Äúunfair‚Äù competition. The impacts of such price regulation merit careful evaluation because the result is likely to be higher prices for consumers or unmet demand. Maximum price regulations are frequently introduced as a necessary corollary to entry restrictions. An alternative is to permit freer entry to the market.",177,govern often regul price tradit monopoli sector util these type price control probabl help consum serv counterweight lack consum altern howev price control also sometim appli situat mani potenti supplier consum when minimum price set low-cost supplier provid better valu consum prevent win market share similarli maximum price set supplier incent innov provid new and/or high-qual product substanti reduc supplier may effect co-ordin price around maximum price minimum price regul sometim respons extrem vigor price competit in case minimum price regul gener seen mean protect small supplier ‚äúunfair‚äù competit the impact price regul merit care evalu result like higher price consum unmet demand maximum price regul frequent introduc necessari corollari entri restrict an altern permit freer entri market
8,B,B2,"Regulations that restrict supplier's ability to advertise or market goods and services often exist to limit false or misleading advertising. Sometimes restrictions are intended to reduce advertising for products or services that are deemed to have a socially negative value or that are subject to excess consumption. At other times, advertising to certain vulnerable  groups, such as children, may be restricted. Restrictions of this nature, when circumscribed to ensure they are not overly broad, can have significant social benefits. In many cases, however, advertising and marketing restrictions are too broad and unduly restrict competition. Restrictions on advertising and marketing are likely to be particularly onerous for potential entrants, as they restrict an entrant‚Äôs ability to inform potential customers of their presence in the market and of the nature and quality of the goods and services that they are able to offer.",141,regul restrict supplier 's abil advertis market good servic often exist limit fals mislead advertis sometim restrict intend reduc advertis product servic deem social neg valu subject excess consumpt at time advertis certain vulner group child may restrict restrict natur circumscrib ensur overli broad signific social benefit in mani case howev advertis market restrict broad unduli restrict competit restrict advertis market like particularli oner potenti entrant restrict entrant‚äô abil inform potenti custom presenc market natur qualiti good servic abl offer
9,B,B3,"Regulations setting standards often provide benefits to consumers and can help to promote new types of products by ensuring that new products from different suppliers are compatible. But standard setting can also provide undue advantages to some suppliers over others. One common example is environmental regulations that limit the allowable emissions of a mildly toxic substance. While limiting emissions is often appropriate to protect public health, regulations can be designed in ways that unfairly advantage a small number of suppliers, for instance, by requiring a particular technology or by setting unduly strict standards that are difficult, or impossible, for less well- resourced producers to meet. Another example where standard-setting can have asignificant anti-competitive impact is when minimum quality standards are set for particular product types. There are often sound objectives underlying such standard-setting, such as consumer protection from risks associated with the use of the product. However, when some consumers prefer lower cost over increased safety, the need for the standard is less clear. Consumer welfare can be reduced by such standards as consumers are prevented from buying cheaper, lower quality goods that they might prefer, even when fully informed of all associated risks.",193,regul set standard often provid benefit consum help promot new type product ensur new product differ supplier compat but standard set also provid undu advantag supplier other one common exampl environment regul limit allow emiss mildli toxic substanc while limit emiss often appropri protect public health regul design way unfairli advantag small number supplier instanc requir particular technolog set unduli strict standard difficult imposs le well- resourc produc meet anoth exampl standard-set asignific anti-competit impact minimum qualiti standard set particular product type there often sound object underli standard-set consum protect risk associ use product howev consum prefer lower cost increas safeti need standard le clear consum welfar reduc standard consum prevent buy cheaper lower qualiti good might prefer even fulli inform associ risk
10,B,B4,"At times, regulations have the effect of raising costs for some suppliers relative to others. One source of cost asymmetry is due to regulations that unnecessarily require the use of one technology of production over another. Another source is the grandfather clause which exempts current suppliers from a regulation but applies it to new entrants. Subsidies or preferential financing for state-owned or preferred enterprises are also a source. Imposition of regulations which were designed for traditional suppliers on digital technology powered businesses may increase their costs. Such arrangements have substantial potential to distort competitive relations within the industry by influencing costs to some suppliers to a greater extent than to others. This can create inefficiency, impede entry, reduce corporate- led innovation and lower the intensity of competitive pressure in the market. While creating cost differentials can be harmful, this does not mean that regulations should always seek uniform supplier costs. Regulations that require registration to practice a particular profession can include grandfather clauses to allow those who have extensive experience within the profession to be registered even if they do not have the training or qualifications necessary for new applications to register. In relation to productive technologies, grandfather clauses are often implemented to ensure adequate time exists to amortise the sunk costs of previous investments.

11,C,C,"Regulations can affect supplier behaviour by not only changing their ability to compete, but also by changing their incentive to act as vigorous rivals. The main reasons suppliers may compete less vigorously are due to regulations that: may facilitate co-ordination between them or reduce the willingness, ability or incentive of customers to switch between different suppliers. Other reasons include profit or market share limits, that restrict potential rewards from competing. Cartel-like behaviour may be more readily generated under self-regulatory or co-regulatory regimes, by increasing the share of supplier output and price information, or by excluding an industry or sector from the reach of competition law. Cartels are harmful because they restrict output and raise prices, making consumers worse off.

12,C,C1,"When an industry or professional association takes full responsibility for regulating the conduct of its members, without government legislative backing (often at the urging of government), the term ‚Äúself-regulation‚Äù is used. However, when a government provides legislative backing to rules that are developed, at least partly, by the industry/professional association, the term ‚Äúco-regulation‚Äù is used. Self-regulatory and co-regulatory structures can yield substantial benefits by ensuring that technical standards are appropriate and that standards advance with technology. However, these structures can have significant anti-competitive impacts.

13,C,C2,"Regulations that require market participants to publish information on their prices or output levels can significantly contribute to the formation of cartels, as a key requirement for cartel operation is that participants can effectively monitor their competitors‚Äô (or co-conspirators market behaviour. Cartels and tacit co-ordination are more likely to arise when: there are fewer participants in the market; entry barriers are high; suppliers‚Äô products are relatively homogeneous; and, information is available before, or soon after, price or output changes occur. Regulations may be adopted that require publication of information, such as price and output levels, to improve consumer information and, sometimes this can improve the efficiency of markets.
