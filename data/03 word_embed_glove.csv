31,Reglamento de Insumos para la Salud,"Medicines require a sanitary registry to be commercialised in Mexico. To apply for a sanitary registry, and for each renewal (currently every five years; see above), pharmaceutical companies need to show that their suppliers possess a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certificate for health inputs. COFEPRIS issues GMP certificates itself, but also recognises certificates from eight foreign authorities: the Food and Drug Administration (US); Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (Brazil); Health Canada (Canada); European Medicines Agency (EU); Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau (Japan); Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia); Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of the Republic of Korea (Korea); and Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Switzerland). The duration of a COFEPRIS- issued GMP certificate is 30 months; other authorities sometimes grant the GMP certificates for longer periods, such as the PFSB in Japan. In addition, various authorities of countries with important suppliers, especially China and India, are currently not recognised by COFEPRIS. If a Mexican pharmaceutical producer wants to use a supplier of ingredients of an unrecognised country, COFEPRIS sends inspectors to certify the foreign supplier's plant.

The Organic Plan describes all production stages and proves compliance with the relevant law and its regulation. The ""conversion period"" is the time during which a producer cannot label its products as organic, but during which production is carried out using approved organic inputs. A previous period can be recognised retroactively as being part of the conversion period if the producer has an analysis registry proving that only permitted inputs were used in the production process.
