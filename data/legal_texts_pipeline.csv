2,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," 6 of the PSA, and such providers would therefore require a Postal Services Operator (PSO) licence. This would include the provision of messenger service7 and intra-organisation mailroom services (multiple premises). The services provided by a messenger are viewed as more of an ancillary business support service for a niche group of customers, as compared to the provision of end-to-end public postal services. Mail collected by a messenger continues to be placed into the postal networks of licensed PSOs for onward processing and delivery. With regard to intra-organisation mailroom services, notwithstanding that they might involve the conveyance of letters between members of one organisation situated in different geographical locations, such services are carried out within the same organisation, and can be deregulated to provide clarity, allow more business flexibility, and reduce the regulatory compliance cost for the industry. Hence, MCI/IMDA proposes amending Section 5 of the PSA to provide regulatory clarity that these mailroom services do not infringe upon IMDA’s exclusive privilege and are to be excluded from licensing8. 7 ‘Messenger service’ is defined as “the collection and processing of outgoing local and international mails from an organisation, followed by the subsequent forwarding of such mails to the postal licensee for delivery to the intended recipients via its postal network”. 8 The provision of inter-organisation mailroom service (i.e. involving mail exchanges between related or affiliated entities) shall remain licensable under the PSA. Page 12 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) Clarifying that the remittance of money and postage stamps are to be provided only by a designated PPL 45. Currently, Sections 11 and 19 of the PSA refer to the role of a PPL in the remittance of money and postage stamps. The current phrasing has been adequate as there is only one PPL. However, this could potentially be ambiguous if more than one party is appointed as a PPL and are interested in the same roles. MCI/IMDA proposes amendments to Sections 11 and 19 to make clear that the right to remit money and the right relating to postage stamps only apply to designated PPLs as approved by IMDA. As a consequence of the proposed amendments to Section 11, amendments to Section 34 are also proposed. Remove instances where the Postal Authority is required to publish a notice before an approved code of practice or standard of performance can take effect 46. MCI/IMDA proposes to delete Section 24(5) of the PSA to remove these requirements for publicity or publication in the PSA for operational flexibility and expediency. Operationally, IMDA will continue to engage postal licensees and affected parties on any changes to the approved codes of practice or standards of performance before any new or amended codes take effect. Question 6: Please provide views and comments on the proposed amendment of Sections 5, 11, 19, 34, 45, 48, 48A, 55 and 55A, the inclusion of the new",en,444
3,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020,"s 48 and 48A to expand the powers of search and arrest and the disposal of letters in respect of offences under Section 33A. The penalty for the contravention of the new Section 33A would be pegged to the existing General Penalties section (Section 52), i.e. any person found guilty is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or to both. 43. MCI/IMDA also proposes to repeal the current Section 55 on offences by bodies of persons, and substitute it with the new Sections 55 and 55A on offences by corporations and offences by unincorporated associations or partnerships. This is merely to update these sections to the current standard provisions dealing with the liability of a director/manager/secretary of a legal person (e.g. a company) that commits an offence under the PSA or its regulations. Exclude messenger services and intra-organisation mailroom service (multiple premises) from the licensing framework 44. Today, the conveyance of letters from one place to another is licensable under",en,158
4,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," currently does not spell out the consequences for breaches of directions given by the Minister under Section 45 of the PSA. MCI/IMDA proposes to amend Section 45 to make clear that a breach is an offence, and to set out the penalty framework for contravening the Minister’s directions, which will be capped at $1 million, similar to the existing cap under the PSA for contravening a direction by IMDA. 6 Developers are still required to provide letter boxes prior to the change of ownership and/or control of the common property. Page 11 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) 42. MCI/IMDA also proposes that the intentional use of unlawful postal services (i.e. postal services that are non-compliant with PSA provisions) should be an offence. This is to prevent the proliferation of unlicensed postal services. Accordingly, MCI/IMDA proposes to add the new Section 33A, and amend",en,140

Today, the Minister may issue a direction to the Postal Authority or postal licensees which may be for purposes related to public emergencies, public security, national defence, foreign relations or the public interest. However, the",en,44

Grant the Postal Authority powers to exempt any person or class of persons from letter box provision 40. Currently, any deviations from the requirement to provide letter boxes require the Minister’s approval under Section 60 of the PSA. MCI/IMDA proposes to include the new Section 17 of the PSA to grant the Postal Authority powers to grant exemptions to any person from the requirement to provide letter boxes under Section 16(3), as such exemptions are operational in nature. This would include instances such as single-tenant buildings seeking exemption to not install letter boxes due to security reasons. Question 5: Please provide views and comments on the proposed amendment of Sections 8 and 16, and the inclusion of the new Sections 7A and 17 of the",en,148
7,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," OF THE POSTAL SECTOR 33. MCI/IMDA has also taken the opportunity to review other sections of the PSA. In this regard, the following proposals are intended to provide greater clarity or serve as administrative amendments to the PSA to strengthen regulatory oversight of the postal sector. Require PPL to provide wholesale access, and Postal Authority to regulate such access, for delivery of non-letters to letter boxes 34. Today, only the PPL has access to masterdoor keys to the letter boxes, due to its Universal Service Obligation (USO) to deliver letters to all addresses in Singapore. Hence, the PPL has a much more extensive last-mile reach compared to other logistics service providers as it is able to deliver small non- letter items into letter boxes. 35. IMDA had considered allowing open access to letter boxes to level the playing field for the delivery of non-letter items into letter boxes. Methods to enable open access could include the duplication of masterdoor keys and installation of smart locks on masterdoors to regulate access. However, we note that giving multiple parties access to the masterdoors of letter boxes may give rise to mail security and/or integrity issues. 36. Instead of allowing open access, MCI/IMDA proposes to make clear that the Postal Authority has the powers to require the provision of, and regulate wholesale access for, the delivery of non-letter items (e.g. small packets/parcels) into letter boxes by the PPL (see new Section 7A and amendments to Section 8). This complements the PPL’s existing requirement to provide wholesale access for the delivery of letters into letter boxes at regulated prices. 37. MCI/IMDA views such regulation of wholesale access for the delivery of non- letter items to letter boxes as necessary and complementary to the introduction of the Network. Many of the non-letter items that are delivered into letter boxes are small, low-value items not sent under a tracked service (i.e. the status of items along the delivery chain is not tracked, and the recipients’ contact numbers are not provided by the sender, so it is not possible to trace the items or notify recipients to collect the items). In contrast, the Network will allow for the delivery of larger, tracked items. Such regulated wholesale access will level the playing field for other logistics service providers and enhance competition in the last-mile delivery services market by extending letter box access for the delivery of non-letter items at regulated terms and conditions. This will help to further close the last-mile infrastructure gaps between the PPL and other logistics service providers for parcel delivery. Page 10 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) Extend the obligation of letter box provision and its maintenance to building owners 38. Currently, Section 16(3) of the PSA requires building developers to provide letter boxes when new buildings are being built. The provision is silent on who should install additional letter boxes or replace them after a building has been transferred to the building owner by the developer, or when letter boxes in a building have been damaged beyond repair. 39. MCI/IMDA is proposing legislative amendments to make it clear that building owners (including town councils and management corporations strata title, or",en,489
9,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020,"s 39B, 39E, 39I(1), 39J and 39K are deemed to be arrestable offences within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68). Question 3: Please provide views and comments on the proposed amendment of Sections 46 and 47(3), and the inclusion of the new Sections 23U, 39A to 39K, 48B and 48C of the PSA to provide IMDA with the powers to enforce and penalise offences relating to the Network. Procedures for appeal to the Minister in relation to the Postal Authority’s decision on the Network 29. Today, any person who is aggrieved by the Postal Authority’s decisions or directions under the relevant sections may appeal to the Minister under Section 56 of the PSA. Accordingly, MCI/IMDA proposes to expand Section 56 to include an appeal procedure for any person (other than the public parcel locker network operator) who is aggrieved by the Postal Authority’s decisions, codes of practice and/or directions made in relation to the Network. Page 8 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) Exclusion of liability of public parcel locker network operator 30. MCI/IMDA proposes to expand the scope of Section 57 so that the public parcel locker network operator is not liable in respect of any injury, loss or damage suffered by any person by reason of the act or default of another person, or an accident or other cause beyond the control of the public parcel locker network operator. These include: a. Any loss or delay of or damage to any parcel that is placed in any public parcel locker; b. The inability to use, or any interruption, suspension or restriction of the use of, a public parcel locker; and c. Any loss of secrecy in communication arising from the use of a public parcel locker. Exemption of the Network from distress 31. MCI/IMDA proposes to expand the scope of Section 58 to exempt the Network from distress and state that it is not liable to be taken in execution under any process of a court in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against any person, without the prior written approval of the Minister. This is to ensure that the policy intent of the provision of the Network as mentioned in paragraph 10 can continue to be met. Regulations in relation to the Network 32. MCI/IMDA proposes to expand the scope of Section 61 to empower the Postal Authority to be able to make regulations in relation to the installation, operation and maintenance of the Network, with the Minister’s approval. Question 4: Please provide views and comments on the proposed expansion of scope in relation to the Network in Sections 56, 57, 58 and 61 of the PSA.

10,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," Revisions to provide the Postal Authority with the powers to own and operate the nationwide parcel locker network at specified premises and appoint a public parcel locker network operator 14. Today, IMDA, as the appointed Postal Authority, has the exclusive privilege of conveying letters and performing all incidental services of receiving, collecting, sorting, sending, dispatching, and delivering letters. Such activities can be undertaken only by the IMDA or parties licensed or authorised by IMDA to do so. MCI/IMDA is proposing to expand the scope of the Postal Authority’s exclusive privilege to include the installation, ownership, and operation of the Network (referred to in the draft Bill as ‘public parcel locker network’) at specified premises. The proposed legislative amendments seek to: a. Address the industry’s concerns by having a neutral parcel locker operator that allocates lockers to logistics service providers, which compete with each other, on a non-discriminatory basis; b. Enable the expeditious deployment and seamless end-to-end service integration of the Network; c. Allow the pervasive deployment of the Network at both high-traffic and underserved locations that provide the public greater convenience; and d. Minimise the dis-amenities stemming from different operators deploying competing parcel locker stations in the same location. 15. The exclusive privilege of the Postal Authority to install, own and operate the Network will be confined to specified premises, defined as: (i) the common property of a building in an HDB housing estate (i.e. HDB void decks, town centres and HDB-managed shopping complexes); (ii) bus interchanges, railway commuter facilities or railway premises (e.g. MRT stations); (iii) community centres/clubs managed or run by the People’s Association4; and (iv) State land adjoining any of the above premises. Additionally, the Minister may, by order in the Gazette, prescribe any other premises as specified premises. 4 For private locker operators with existing lockers installed at HDB residential estates and MRT stations as part of the Locker Alliance pilot, or in community centres/clubs, contracts will expire in 2020 and 2021, after which IMDA will install its lockers as part of the Network. IMDA will grant exemptions to these operators for a specified time period. Page 5 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) 16. MCI/IMDA also clarifies that the exclusive privilege does not apply to the conveyance of parcels into the Network. The exclusive privilege pertains only to the establishment, installation, operation and maintenance of the Network. 17. The Postal Authority will appoint a public parcel locker network operator to perform the Postal Authority’s function and duty to establish, install, operate and maintain the Network. The public parcel locker network operator will be subject to conditions that are imposed by the Postal Authority. These may include terms and conditions on the use of and access to the Network, including any pricing and rate charges. In the first instance, the Network will be operated by IMDA’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pick Network Pte Ltd. 18. Notwithstanding the above, the Postal Authority will also retain residual power to deploy and run a Network if: (i) the Postal Authority is of the view that the public parcel locker network operator is not complying with its obligations; or (ii) to give effect to any direction of the Minister. In this case, the Postal Authority may determine the terms and conditions of the use of and access to the Network, including any pricing and rate charges. 19. Further to that, the Postal Authority may also prescribe classes of parcels (e.g. hazardous material, controlled substances, etc.) that are prohibited from being placed in the Network, for reasons such as security and safety concerns. Question 1: Please provide views and comments on the proposed inclusion of the new Sections 23A to 23G and amendment to Section 3A of the PSA to accord the Postal Authority the exclusive privilege to install, own and operate the Network in specified premises and appoint a public parcel locker network operator. Requirement for building owners and developers of specified premises to provide space or facility and access thereto for the installation and operation of the nationwide parcel locker network 20. To ensure that residents can benefit from having public parcel lockers near their homes, it is important to ensure that the public parcel locker network operator or the Postal Authority can secure the necessary spaces, and access required for the timely installation and maintenance of the parcel lockers. The powers and the key procedures (including any disputes as to compensation) are laid out in the new Sections 23H to 23T of the PSA. 21. Specifically, MCI/IMDA intends for the provision, maintenance and access to spaces for public parcel lockers to be provided at the owner/developer’s own expense, as they are social and public infrastructure intended to close the last- mile delivery gap, and provide positive externalities, such as greater convenience for consumers and more options for parcel deliveries. Page 6 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) 22. In this regard, MCI/IMDA is proposing legislative amendments to empower the Postal Authority to issue one or more codes of practice to regulate and facilitate the use of, and access to, space or facility in specified premises for the deployment of the Network. The proposed regulatory framework aims to cover the following key aspects: a. Developers and building owners must provide space and/or facility, and access thereto, upon request by IMDA and/or the public parcel locker operator which is required to provide nationwide coverage5; and b. Such provision of space and/or facility within the specified premises will be limited to the public parcel locker network operator for the purposes of the Network, and to enable timely deployment and minimise delays caused by negotiations. The operator will not be required to pay for the right to enter or use any land or premises. Question 2: Please provide views and comments on the proposed inclusion of the new Sections 23H to 23T of the PSA to provide IMDA with the powers to establish a framework to regulate and facilitate the use of, and access to, space or facility in specified premises for the deployment of the Network, and to provide the public parcel locker network operator with powers related to the installation, operation, and maintenance of public parcel lockers. Enforcement powers and offences relating to public parcel lockers deployed at specified premises 23. Today, any postal article sent by post which is suspected to be sent in contravention of the PSA (or any regulations made under the PSA) may be detained and examined by the Public Postal Licensee (PPL) or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the directions of the Postal Authority. 24. With the establishment of the Network, similar provisions will have to be put in place for parcels or objects placed or found in the Network. These include powers for the Postal Authority, or the public parcel network operator under the direction of the Postal Authority, to detain and examine such parcels or objects. Such powers are only for the purposes of: (i) investigations into cases where the parcel, article or object is or is suspected to be the subject of or used in the commission of offences under the PSA and its regulations; or (ii) when the presence of the parcel, article or object in the public parcel locker is contrary to public safety and security. 5 Building owners cannot reject such requests for parcel locker deployments unless approved by IMDA under exceptional circumstances, e.g. where such deployments may breach safety standards. Page 7 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) 25. These provisions are included under the new Sections 23U and 48B, while the new Section 48C sets out the follow-up actions for parcels and objects detained or seized under the PSA. 26. MCI/IMDA also proposes to expand Section 46 on the power to require information for the purpose of conducting an investigation or discharging its function under the PSA to include the Network. 27. In addition, to ensure the safe use and operation of the Network, MCI/IMDA proposes to introduce the new Sections 39A to 39K which, among others, set out penalties for any person who commits offences such as: a. Removing, destroying or damaging the public parcel locker infrastructure and its related installations; b. Unlawfully operating or using a parcel locker at or on any specified premises; c. Intentionally obstructing the public parcel locker network operator from carrying out its duties; d. Fraudulently retaining, disposing, removing or damaging any parcel placed in the Network; and e. Placing any item, including prohibited items, in the Network that may be hazardous or considered offensive. 28. Accordingly, MCI/IMDA proposes to amend Section 47(3) so that the new",en,1320
13,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," II: MARKET SHIFTS IN THE POSTAL SECTOR Background 5. The postal services market was fully liberalised in 2007. Today, there are four companies1 licensed to deliver letter mail in Singapore. The delivery of non- letters (e.g. small packets and parcels) does not require a licence. There are many operators, including international service providers2, providing delivery of non-letters. 6. MCI/IMDA has observed changes in the mailing habits of consumers and businesses. There continues to be a shift towards substituting letters with electronic means of communications (i.e. e-substitution), such as e-mail and e- invoicing, which has resulted in declining letter mail volumes. Concurrent with the above shift, there has been a growing number of small packets and parcels, driven by e-commerce. These trends, taken in tandem, have resulted in a higher proportion of non-letters being received and delivered via the public postal network. 7. The surge in parcels delivered through the postal network is expected to intensify, given that e-commerce volumes were projected to grow at 12% to 20% annually over the next five years3, even before the onset of COVID-19. Today, most parcels are delivered to the doorstep. Doorstep deliveries reduce logistics service providers’ productivity as they take more time and resources, especially when repeated trips to the same address are needed due to failed deliveries. Consumers are also inconvenienced by failed doorstep deliveries. The current letter box infrastructure is also not designed to receive all parcels for last-mile delivery. 8. Besides doorstep delivery, consumers can collect their parcels through other means, such as from parcel lockers operated by private-sector locker operators. However, the current level of last-mile parcel locker deployments would not be able to support the projected growth in parcel volumes. MCI/IMDA has also observed that the parcel locker market is fragmented and has thus far been generally private-sector driven. Competing players have built proprietary networks, with each operator’s parcel lockers forming a ‘closed system’ that is not designed to be accessed by other operators. In addition, such parcel lockers are largely concentrated and duplicated in commercial areas with high footfall, with most parts of the residential market being underserved. With the increasing demands and expectations for reliable last-mile parcel delivery, there is a need for the public postal infrastructure to evolve to offer practical alternatives to doorstep deliveries and private sector-owned parcel lockers. 1 The four companies licensed as postal service operators are Asendia Singapore Pte Ltd; DHL eCommerce (Singapore) Pte Ltd; Singapore Post Limited; and World Marketing Group Pte Ltd. 2 These include SingPost, DHL, FedEx, Ninja Van, UPS, Ta-Q-Bin, etc. 3 Sources: Industry estimates, e-Conomy SEA 2019.   Page 3 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill) 9. In December 2018, IMDA led an inter-agency pilot, Locker Alliance, to validate the demand for an open-access, shared parcel locker infrastructure for last-mile parcel delivery. The aim of such infrastructure was to provide greater convenience to consumers with 24/7 access to the parcel lockers, enhance efficiency with aggregated deliveries to lockers instead of individual homes, and create an open and interoperable network for logistics service providers and e- commerce marketplaces to access a single network. A total of 70 parcel locker stations were built by private-sector operators in collaboration with IMDA in Punggol and Bukit Panjang HDB towns, and eight MRT stations. The pilot received positive responses from both logistics service providers and users. Our vision and strategy 10. Building on the results of the pilot programme, MCI/IMDA aims to transform the infrastructure for last-mile parcel delivery by deploying a new nationwide network of parcel lockers to complement the existing letter box infrastructure. This new infrastructure, to be deployed at HDB estates, public transport nodes and community spaces, will provide consumers with greater convenience and options for parcel deliveries, and enable the logistics sector to realise productivity gains and cost savings. The proposed changes to the PSA seek to enable this transformation. 11. The findings from the Locker Alliance pilot validated and reinforced the need to transform the last-mile parcel delivery infrastructure. To this end, 1,000 parcel locker stations will be deployed by end 2021 throughout Singapore. In public residential areas where parcel locker stations are deployed, each station will be located about five minutes’ walk or within 250m of residents’ homes. 12. The Network will be an open-access network, which will (subject to conditions) allow any logistics service provider or e-commerce marketplace to use the lockers. Logistics service providers shall access the public parcel lockers by interfacing with a software platform that enables interoperability. 13. Details of MCI/IMDA’s proposals are in the sections below. Page 4 of 14 ANNEX A – Public consultation paper on draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill)",en,709
14,SG_Public Consultation Paper on Draft Amendment 2020," 1: INTRODUCTION 1. The Postal Services Act (PSA) is the legislative framework that governs the regulation of Singapore’s postal sector. Under the PSA, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), as the appointed Postal Authority, has the powers to grant or modify licences, issue directions, codes of practice and standards of performance, amongst others, for the conveyance of letters weighing 500 grams or less. IMDA’s functions include ensuring that postal services are reasonably accessible to all people in Singapore, and are supplied as efficiently and economically as practicable. 2. The PSA was last revised in 2007, when IMDA fully liberalised Singapore’s postal services market. The postal landscape has since evolved and there have been shifts in the market, such as the growth in e-commerce deliveries. It is therefore timely for the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), together with IMDA, to ensure that the legislative framework for postal systems and services provided for in the PSA remains relevant to and appropriate in the current environment. 3. The proposed legislative amendments to the PSA seek to address the existing postal landscape and ongoing developments, in order to ensure that the PSA evolves to meet the social, industrial, and commercial needs of Singapore. They will also clarify and enhance existing legislation. 4. MCI/IMDA is launching this public consultation to seek views and comments on the proposed drafting of the revisions to the PSA. This consultation paper summarises and outlines the key policies reviewed, the rationale for the review, and the procedures for members of the industry and public to submit their views and comments by 23 December 2020.

53,SG_Guidelines for Postal Service Operations 2019," licence applications. Regulatory Framework 3.26 All PSO licensees including PPLs will be regulated in accordance with the licensing and regulatory frameworks established by the Authority, which are formulated under the provisions of the Act. Licensees are also required to comply with the Code of Practice for Competition in the Provision of Postal Services (“Postal Competition Code”), which aims to ensure the development of a fair and competitive postal environment in Singapore. Other codes of practice and regulatory guidelines include the Postal Operations Code, Accounting Separation Guidelines and minimum Quality of Services standards. Interested parties may refer to the Authority’s website for the copy of a generic PSO licence or the licences issued to other PSO licensees, the Postal Competition Code, the Postal Operations Code and other relevant guidelines issued by the Authority6. 3.27 The Authority will continue to review and refine the postal framework and codes of practice to ensure their relevance, taking into consideration market trends and developments. Licence Fees and Licence Duration 3.28 In general, an annual licence fee for PSOs will be payable by each licensee in a sum amounting to 0.4% of the licensee’s Annual Gross Turnover (“AGTO”)7, subject to a minimum amount which depends on the services offered. There is no initial one-time licence fee payable. The duration of the licence depends on the scope of the licensee’s operations. Successful applicants for the PSO licence will be required to pay the relevant licence fees as stipulated below: Licence Licence Fee  PSO designated as Initial Fee: None",en,227
54,SG_Guidelines for Postal Service Operations 2019," licensees may apply to be designated as a PPL under section 6 of the Act. In order to qualify to apply to be designated as a PPL, the PSO licensee must demonstrate that its postal network is able to handle incoming and outgoing mail, both domestic and international, to all postal address in Singapore, within the existing Quality of Service (“QoS”) established by the Authority for PPLs. For example, part of the current QoS for domestic mail requires 98% of letters to be delivered by the next working day and the remaining by the following day. For the full details of QoS, please refer to the posted QoS requirements at   – “Regulations, Licensing and Consultation -> ICT Standards and Quality of Service” – “Quality of Service”. 3.19 PPLs are required to perform a set of universal service obligations (“USO”), for the provision of island-wide letter collection and delivery services to any person who request for such services. PPLs will also be required to establish island-wide post boxes for collection of letters, post offices, and sorting facilities as determined by the Authority. PPLs will enjoy certain safeguards under the Act to facilitate the performance of their USO. 3.20 Currently, SingPost is the PPL that is designated as the postal administration for Singapore in the UPU. Should another PPL request to be the designated as the postal administration for Singapore in the UPU, the Authority will evaluate the merits of its requests accordingly and will also take into consideration whether the UPU allows for two licensees to be designated at any one time. 3.21 In the interest of ensuring mail security and integrity in the public postal system and safeguarding consumers’ interests, the Authority will currently not allow multiple PPLs to have access to the HDB letterbox masterdoor keys. Version 5 – 1 November 2019 Page 5 of 10 The Authority will instead facilitate PSO and PPL’s access to SingPost’s delivery network at regulated prices, terms and conditions. Competing PSOs and PPLs can also attempt to deliver mail to letterboxes with open apertures or to the recipients’ premises. 3.22 PPLs can issue stamps imprints and use prepayment impressions as mentioned in the above paragraph 3.10. However, only one PPL, SingPost, is designated to issue national stamps. As national stamps carry the name of the country and not the name of the PPL, it may not be feasible to allow multiple PPLs to issue the same set of national stamps for pre-payment purposes. It will cause consumer confusion and significant difficulty in ensuring that the correct PPL is being paid for the services to be provided. 3.23 For greater operational efficiency and in the public interest, a single national postal code system will be adopted. SingPost will administer and manage the national postal code system. The Authority will not allow another PPL to formulate its own postal codes for conveyance of letters in Singapore. However, the Authority will require SingPost to provide all PSOs access to the national postal code database on request. Further details can be found in the Code of Practice for Common Operational Procedures in the Provision of Postal Services (the “Postal Operations Code”) [to be] issued by the Authority. 3.24 In both the PSO and PPL licence, the Authority reserves the right to impose certain basic service obligations where necessary. Licence Evaluation 3.25 The Authority will evaluate a PSO licence application based on its merits. The Authority will take into account the following in its evaluation of the merits of an applicant’s proposal: (a) vision of the applicant and how this will contribute towards the public and the economy of Singapore; (b) organisational structure and financial capability and strength of the applicant; (c) business and competition strategies of the applicant for the provision of services; soundness of the applicant’s business plans and capability to implement the plans; (d) ability in ensuring security and integrity of postal articles; and (e) any other information provided by the applicant. The Authority will consider the benefits that will be brought by the applicant to end-users and the Singapore economy as a whole in terms of the investments in Singapore; level of service innovation and responsiveness; range and choice of products and services offerings; competitive pricing; level of quality of service5 and level of customer service support; and resource limitations and physical constraints, before awarding a licence to an applicant. 5 The Authority currently only imposes QoS requirements on designated Public Postal Licensees that are mentioned in paragraph 3.14 of these guidelines.

In determining whether to issue such an interim direction, the Authority will consider whether: (a) there is prima facie evidence that the Licensee has contravened any provision of this Code; (b) continuation of the Licensee’s conduct is likely to cause harm to consumers or the general public; (c) the potential harm from allowing the Licensee to continue its conduct outweighs the burden on the Licensee of ceasing such prohibited conduct or complying with the conduct specified by the Authority; or (d) issuance of the interim direction is in the public interest. 10.5 Enforcement measures 10.5.1 In the event that the Authority concludes that a Licensee has contravened any provision of this Code, the Authority may take such enforcement measures as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to: (a) the issuance of a warning to the Licensee containing a statement of the Authority’s basis for concluding that the Licensee has acted in contravention of any provision of this Code, but will impose no further sanction; (b) the issuance of a direction to the Licensee to cease engaging in contravening conduct or to take specific actions to comply with any provision of this Code; and/or (c) the imposition of a financial penalty of up to S$1 million per contravention under section 9 of the Act on a Licensee for contravention of a provision of this Code. 10.5.2 In imposing financial penalties, the Authority will consider any aggravating factors. These factors include: (a) whether the contravention was serious; (b) whether the contravention continued for an extended period; 9 (c) whether the Licensee acted wilfully, recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner; (d) whether the Licensee has a previous history of contraventions; and (e) whether the Licensee made any effort to conceal the contravention. 10.5.3 In imposing financial penalties, the Authority will also consider any mitigating factors. These factors include: (a) whether the contravention was minor; (b) whether the Licensee took prompt action to correct the contravention; (c) whether the contravention was accidental; and (d) whether the Licensee voluntarily disclosed the contravention to the Authority and cooperated with the Authority in its investigation. 10.6 Suspension or cancellation of licence 10.6.1 Under section 9 of the Act, if the Authority is satisfied that a Licensee has, among other things, contravened this Code and: (a) the Licensee is, among other things, likely to again contravene, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Code; or (b) the public interest so requires, The Authority may, in lieu of a financial penalty or an order under section 9(1) of the Act, cancel or suspend the relevant licence (or part thereof) or reduce the period for which the licence is in force. 10.7 Decision to be complied with pending review 10.7.1 Unless otherwise provided, where an appeal is made under section 56 of the Act, the decision, direction or any other matter which is appealed against shall be strictly complied with until the determination of the appeal. 10.8 Dispute resolution 10.8.1 Where Licensees fail to voluntarily reach an agreement regarding any dispute in relation to the requirements of this Code, any of the Licensees involved in the dispute may request the Authority to resolve the dispute. In raising the dispute to the Authority, the Licensees must comply with the dispute resolution procedure specified by the Authorityfrom time to time. 10 Made this 9 June 2017.",en,2425

202,SG_Postal Accounting Separation Framework 2010," maintenance procedures Details of the procedures for maintenance and updating of the PCAM and associated internal controls. Reporting requirements Description of each of the statements required. Product definitions Definitions of each of the product/services and details of how the Reporting Licensee’s services map to such. Allocation principles As set out in the ASF, but with additional detail for those allocation principles that are not specified in the framework. Allocation procedures Details of any studies, surveys or models that are used for allocation purposes. In this regard, the PCAM should provide working examples of all of the allocation methods that are used. Detailed General Ledger (“GL”) For each GL line used by the Reporting Licensee, the mapping and allocation following information should be provided: - GL account number and description - Allocation principle (i.e. Direct, attributable or unattributable); - Allocation method (i.e. For all indirectly attributable and unattributable costs and Page 5 of 10 revenues, this would be a description of the model or survey used as the allocation basis) and the details of the allocation techniques, assumptions made and cross references to the file/data for audit purposes; - Allocation drivers (e.g. Floor space, number of staff, minutes of usage, etc). Glossary Definition of terms used in the PCAM. Modifications of Procedures and Cost Allocation Manual for Compliance with Accounting Separation Framework 17. Any changes to the PCAM proposed by the Reporting Licensee must be filed with the Authority and are subject to the Authority’s approval, for compliance with this framework, prior to implementation. 18. Proposed changes should be accompanied by a statement of reasons justifying the changes, and the financial impact of the proposed changes should be illustrated. 19. The Authority may request the Reporting Licensee to provide further information for the purposes of its consideration of the proposed changes. 20. The Authority will consider the proposed changes and notify the Reporting Licensee of its approval as soon as practicable. 21. The Authority may require the Reporting Licensee to amend its procedures for compliance with this framework from time to time. A requirement for amendment to the procedures will be notified in writing to the Reporting Licensee. 22. The Authority may require an amendment to the procedures to be effected within a certain time period. 23. For the purposes of illustrating the effect of the changes, the Reporting Licensee should submit reporting statements for the previous one financial year upon obtaining The Authority’s approval to implement the changes. However, the Authority reserves the right to request for additional information if the need arises. Level of Disaggregation 24. To monitor Reporting Licensees’ compliance with the prohibitions in the PCC against abuse of Dominant Position and unfair methods of competition, it is crucial for the Authority to understand the profitability of the product/services of Reporting Licensees on an individual or separate basis, rather than as reported on an aggregate basis as adopted in statutory reports. For this reason, the Reporting Licensee is to adopt the level of disaggregation along the following service segments when preparing their ASF submissions: Domestic Basic Letters • All local Basic Letter services, except those provided on bulk rates Page 6 of 10 International Basic Letters • All international Basic Letter services, except those provided on bulk rates Domestic Bulk Letters • All local Basic Letter services provided on bulk rates • These services should be further disaggregated into: - Self-use (i.e. services provided by the Reporting Licensee to itself) - Services provided to other Postal Service Operators (“PSO”s) - Services provided to other entities International Bulk Letters • All international Basic Letter services provided on bulk rates • To be further disaggregated into: - Self-use - Services provided to other PSOs - Services provided to other entities Other Mail Services All other mail or mail related value added services, excluding all types of Basic Letter services (e.g. Express Letter Services, Direct Mail, Letters above 500g, Printed Papers etc.) Others • All other services, products, businesses not covered in the segments above (e.g. property-related services, advertising services etc.) Please refer to Annex A for an illustrative table. Reporting Requirements 25. The Reporting Licensee must prepare and submit the following statements on an annual basis, with the information submitted within four months after the end of each of the Reporting Licensee’s full financial year, in accordance with the procedures and allocations set out in the PCAM. (a) Segment Income Statement A separate Segment Income Statement must be prepared for each of the segments that the Reporting Licensee is required to disaggregate to. Each Segment Income Statement must report: i) The revenues for each segment, with separate identification of revenues from external sources; revenues from the Reporting Licensee’s internal businesses; and revenues from Affiliates. ii) The costs for each segment, with separate identification of fixed and variable costs. A suggested format that the Reporting Licensee may use for submission of the Segment Income Statement is illustrated in Annex B1. Page 7 of 10 (b) Reconciliation of Consolidated Income Statement Where the Reporting Licensee provides services in more than one segment as a single entity, it must prepare and submit a Reconciliation of Consolidated Income Statement consolidating the segments provided by the entity. This is to ensure that the figures used in the ASF statements are traceable and reconcilable to the Reporting Licensee’s Group statutory accounts and the accounting records that underlie its Group statutory accounts. This statement should report: i) A summary of revenues, operating costs and return for each segment; ii) Consolidated adjustments, with separate identification of each adjustment item; and iii) Reconciliation to the Reporting Licensee’s audited Income Statement. A suggested format that the Reporting Licensee may use for submission of the Reconciliation of Consolidated Income Statement is illustrated in Annex B2. (c) Statement of Transactions with Affiliates This statement is to be provided, in relation to paragraph 25(a), where details of the intra-company and inter-company transactions that the Reporting Licensee has conducted between itself and its affiliates need to be reflected. A suggested format for this statement is illustrated in Annex C. (d) Auditor’s Report Audit and Compliance 26. An independent auditor is required to provide an audit report to the Authority, on all information and reports submitted by the Reporting Licensee under the requirements of the ASF. The aim of the audit is to ensure that information submitted to the Authority is reliable and that the Reporting Licensee has complied with the requirement of the ASF. 27. The independent auditor must be a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore and shall conduct his audit in accordance with the Singapore Standards on Auditing. 28. The independent auditor shall be appointed by the Reporting Licensee, and responsibility for completion of the audit lies with the Reporting Licensee. However, the Authority may request meetings with the Reporting Licensee’s independent auditor to discuss the auditors‟ work and the Reporting Licensee shall ensure that this is provided for in the Letter of Engagement or contract with its independent auditor. Page 8 of 10 29. If the Authority is not satisfied that an independent audit will be or has been conducted properly, the Authority may appoint another independent auditor to conduct the audit. All external audit costs, whether appointed by the Reporting Licensee or the Authority, are to be borne by the Reporting Licensee. 30. The Reporting Licensee shall grant the independent auditor, or any person authorised by him, the right of access at any reasonable time to the accounting and other records of the Reporting Licensee, and to require from any officer of the Reporting Licensee such information and explanations as he desires for the purposes of the audit. 31. The independent auditor shall, in the Auditor’s Report, express an opinion on: (a) whether the AS statements for the year ended have been properly drawn up in accordance with the Reporting Licensee’s PCAM that has been approved by the Authority, and so as to present fairly in all material respects the information contained in: and (b) whether all changes to the PCAM that materially affect the AS statements for the year ended have been filed with, and approved by the Authority. 32. The independent auditor shall also state in the Auditor’s report, or make a reference in the Auditor’s report, to any special report as may appear to him to be necessary, on: (a) any material non-compliance with the PCAM pertaining to those AS statements, and the impact thereof; and (b) any other deficiency or failure, or such other matters arising from the audit as he considers should be reported, in respect of matters relating to the AS statements. These include, but are not limited to, failure to obtain from the Reporting Licensee all information and explanations that he requires, and the audited statutory financial statements being subject to a qualification by the auditor. 33. The Auditor’s Report to the Reporting Licensee shall be attached to the AS statement for the purposes of submission to the Authority. Confidentiality 34. As information in the ASF reports provided by the Reporting Licensee to the Authority may be of a commercially sensitive nature, the Authority will: (a) in general, limit the disclosure of such information to the Authority’s staff, legal advisers and consultants only on a need to know basis and only to the extent that is necessary to enable the Authority to fulfil its statutory duties and functions; and (b) use the information only for the Authority’s regulatory statement and duties. Page 9 of 10 35. The Authority will disclose the information to external third parties only if the Authority considers such disclosure to be necessary in the pursuit of the Government’s info-communications policy, its objectives or resolution of a dispute. The Authority will give the Reporting Licensee a reasonable opportunity to make representations on the proposed disclosure before the Authority makes a final decision whether to disclose the information. Modification of Accounting Separation Framework 36. This framework may be updated and revised from time to time to cater for changes in practices, standards and the level of competition in the Basic Letter Services market, the introduction of new products and technologies and the need to refine practices and principles. 37. In general, a change to this framework will be effective six months after the change is notified by the Authority, unless the Authority considers it necessary to require a change to be implemented at an earlier or later date. In determining the timeframe for implementation of changes to this framework, the Authority will consider the nature of the change and the likely impact of the change on the Reporting Licensee’s reporting procedures.

203,SG_Postal Accounting Separation Framework 2010,"POSTAL ACCOUNTING SEPARATION FRAMEWORK (with effect from 1 June 2010) Definitions 1. In this framework, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires: (a) “Affiliate”, in relation to a Dominant Licensee, means another Licensee; (i) that has an attributable interest in the Dominant Licensee of 5% or more (parent); (ii) in which the Dominant Licensee, has an attributable interest of 5% or more (subsidiary); or (iii) in which any parent of the Dominant Licensee, has an attributable interest of 5% or more (sibling), provided that a Licensee will not be deemed an Affiliate of the Dominant Licensee based solely on the fact that both the Licensee’s and the Dominant Licensee’s ultimate parent has a passive interest in both; (In determining a relevant party’s attributable interest, the Info- communications Media Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “Authority”) will use the “sum-the-percentages” methodology1. This methodology will be applied successively at each level of the ownership chain.) (b) “Basic Letter” means a Letter, other than a Direct Mail or an Express Letter, of up to 500 grams in weight; (c) “Dominant Licensee” means a Licensee that the Authority has classified as dominant, in one or more Basic Letter Services markets, pursuant to one or more of the criteria specified in Section 2.2 of the Postal Competition Code 2008 (“PCC”), and which is subject to the special obligations applicable to Dominant Licensees when it provides service in that market; (d) “Express Letter” means a local express letter or an international express letter, or both; (e) “Letter” means any communication in written form on any kind of physical medium to be conveyed and delivered (otherwise than electronically) to a particular addressee or address indicated by the Sender on the Letter itself or on its wrapping, and includes a postal 1 For example, if the relevant party has legal or beneficial ownership of 100 per cent of the voting shares of Entity A, and Entity A has legal or beneficial ownership of 50 per cent of the voting shares of Entity B, and Entity B has legal or beneficial ownership of 50 per cent of the voting shares of Entity C, then the relevant party will be deemed to have a 25 per cent attributable interest in Entity C. In this case, Entity C will be deemed to be an “Affiliate” of the relevant party. Correspondingly, where a party is said to be “affiliated” with another party, the first party is an “Affiliate” of the second party Page 1 of 10 article containing such communication, but excludes any book, catalogue, newspaper or periodical; (f) “Licensee” means: (i) any entity to which the Authority has granted a licence under section 6 of the Postal Services Act for the provision of a Basic Letter Service; or (ii) any entity who is deemed to have been granted a class licence under the Postal Services (Class Licence) Regulations 2005; (g) “Reporting Licensee” means any Dominant Licensee and its Affiliates, subject to Section 4 of this framework. Objectives 2. This Accounting Separation Framework (“ASF”) prescribes the minimum requirements necessary to provide a structured regulatory reporting framework to enable the Authority to: (a) ensure that services that are provided internally by Dominant Licensees to their downstream operations or to their Affiliates, are provided on similar terms to equivalent services provided to other unrelated Licensees; (b) monitor Dominant Licensees‟ compliance with the cross-subsidisation provisions under the PCC; and (c) establish and maintain objective reference points for evaluating information provided by Licensees in relation to specific studies which may occur from time to time such as costing studies and investigation of potential predatory pricing, price squeezes, discrimination and other anti- competitive conduct. 3. The framework also serves to: (a) provide a structured approach for a Reporting Licensee’s adherence when submitting required Accounting Separation (“AS”) information to the Authority; and (b) ensure that the Reporting Licensee submit required AS information to the Authority on a timely, consistent and accurate basis. Page 2 of 10 Application of Accounting Separation Framework to Dominant Licensees 4. This ASF applies to all Licensees that are classified as Dominant Licensees pursuant to Section 2.2 of the PCC. In addition, the Authorityreserves the right to subject Affiliates of Dominant Licensees to this ASF, if the Authorityconcludes that this is necessary for the achievement of the objectives specified in Sections 2 and 3 above. General Accounting Principles and Policies 5. Accounting practices and policies adopted for the purposes of submission to the Authorityshould conform to the accounting policies used by the Reporting Licensee in its statutory financial reports and should be consistent with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. However, from time to time, the Authority may require the Reporting Licensee to adopt particular accounting practices for the purpose of compliance with this framework. 6. The Reporting Licensee shall apply the same practices consistently from year to year to afford meaningful comparisons of submitted AS information over time. Whenever changes are made to accounting practices and policies, the Reporting Licensee is required to give a detailed explanation for the change, and illustrate the financial impact of the changes on reports to be submitted to the Authority. Submissions to the Authority for the previous one year will also have to be restated, using the new practices and policies. However, the Authority shall reserve the right to request for more information should the need arise. Waivers to prescribed accounting practices are permitted in cases where the adoption of an alternative practice is not material to the context of the Authority’s review of the Reporting Licensee’s compliance with the PCC. Cost Basis and Costing Standard 7. Separate accounts should be prepared on a historical cost accounting basis, in accordance with the basis for preparation of the Reporting Licensee’s statutory financial statements, subject to variations allowed or directed by the Authority. 8. A fully distributed cost allocation basis should be followed. This means that all of the Reporting Licensee’s costs, including corporate costs, should be fully apportioned among the Reporting Licensee’s products and services. 9. Insofar as in-house products/services are used by the Reporting Licensee in the provision of other product/services, the Reporting Licensee should ensure that its cost allocation system charges transfer prices at the same rate as that imposed on external operators or customers using those products/services. General Allocation Principles 10. Revenue and costs should be allocated to the products/services by means of causation or using an activity-driven approach. That is, costs and revenue should be allocated to those services or products that cause the cost or revenue to arise. In particular, the following process should be followed: (a) Review each cost and revenue item; Page 3 of 10 (b) Identify the driver, i.e. the process that caused the cost to be incurred or the revenue to be earned; and (c) Use the driver to attribute the cost or revenue to the relevant product or service, and accordingly, to the appropriate AS segment. Cost Attribution 11. Wherever possible, costs should be attributed directly to a product/service. Costs may be attributed according to the following categories: (a) Direct cost: Costs which are solely generated by a particular service/product, and are recorded in the accounts against the relevant product/service. (b) Directly attributable costs: Costs which are solely generated by a particular product/service but are not recorded in the accounts against the relevant product/service. (c) Indirectly attributable costs: Costs which are part of a pool of common costs but which can be attributed to a particular service/product through a non-arbitrary and verifiable cause and effect relationship. There is no requirement for this to be a one-to-one relationship and it may be multi- step. (d) Unattributable costs: Costs which are part of a pool of common costs and cannot be identified to a particular service/ product through a non- arbitrary and verifiable cause and effect relationship. The amount of unattributable costs should be kept to a minimum. 12. The bases and assumptions used to attribute costs should be reasonable, and should, when necessary, be substantiated by time studies, historical data and usage patterns, sampling techniques or other analyses. Types of Cost 13. The Reporting Licensee is required to separately identify the categories of costs into Fixed Costs and Variable Costs, where: (d) Fixed Costs are costs which do not vary with the volume of output of an activity, product or service. Such costs are associated with fixed factors of production and cannot be avoided unless all contributory output is ceased; and (e) Variable Costs are costs which vary with the volume of output of an activity, product or service. Such costs are associated with variable factors of production. Page 4 of 10 Procedures and Cost Allocation Manual 14. Cost attribution bases and assumptions must be consistently applied by the Reporting Licensee in the preparation of ASF submissions, i.e. the same bases should be used from year to year to ensure comparability. 15. The Reporting Licensee is to document in detail, the methodology to be used for allocating costs in a Procedures and Cost Allocation Manual (“PCAM”). This manual must prescribe the use of existing accounting and other internal reporting systems, as far as is relevant and practicable, to achieve the objectives of this framework. Each Reporting Licensee’s PCAM is subject to the Authority’s approval, and a copy of the PCAM shall be provided to the Authority in hardcopy. 16. The Reporting Licensee’s PCAM shall contain a comprehensive and complete written statement of the policies, principles and methodologies that the Reporting Licensee will follow in preparing its AS statements. It must be sufficiently detailed to enable an external party or an external auditor to understand the methodologies that have been used in preparing such statements. It should include audit control procedures and trails used in data preparation to assist in an audit review. In particular, the PCAM should include the following information: Organisational structure Background information on the structure of a Reporting Licensee’s organisation and its broad lines of business. This should include details of the business units within the organisation and the relationships between support units and the main business streams. Group structure List of the entities covered by the reporting and the relationships between the entities, where the information relates to more than one entity. Accounting systems Details of the financial, accounting and operational systems used by the Reporting Licensee for the capture and generation of the AS information. Accounting policies Details of the accounting policies used by the Reporting Licensee in preparing the AS statements.",en,1560

The Code 2008 is hereby cancelled as of the date of issuance of this Code. 10.3 Savings Provision Except as otherwise provided, and so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code, any action, approval, decision, designation, direction, exemption and notification taken, granted, issued, made, published or approved by IMDA in relation to any matter under the Code 2008 will continue in effect and will be deemed to have been taken, granted, issued, made, published or approved by IMDA under the corresponding provisions of this Code. 10.4 General Transition Rules 10.4.1 Contraventions Before the Effective Date of this Code (a) Subject to section 10.4.2 of this Code, a person will not be found to be in contravention of any provision of this Code in respect of any agreement entered into, or act or conduct that occurred, before the Effective Date of this Code. Rather, the person shall remain liable for any contravention under the Code 2008 in respect of such agreement, act or conduct, as if the Code 2008 had not been revoked. Any such enforcement action is subject to the time limitation set out in section 9.2.6 of the Code 2008. In this respect, any enforcement proceeding commenced before the Effective Date of this Code may be continued and completed under the provisions of the Code 2008, as if the Code 2008 had not been revoked. However, any right of appeal in relation to that proceeding shall be 92 exercised, heard and determined under section 9.7 of this Code. (b) Where the enforcement action is commenced after the Effective Date of this Code, the procedures set out in sections 9.2 through 9.7 (except section 9.2.6) of this Code shall apply to the enforcement action. 10.4.2 Application of this Code to Continuing Agreement, Act and Conduct Any agreement entered into or act or conduct that occurred prior to the Effective Date of this Code, but which continues after the Effective Date of this Code, will be governed by the terms of this Code from the Effective Date of this Code. IMDA will not take enforcement action against a person under the Code 2008 for the same contravening agreement, act or conduct. 10.4.3 Uncompleted Proceedings under the Revoked Postal Competition Code (a) Without prejudice to section 10.4.1 of this Code, any proceeding commenced before the Effective Date of this Code, but which remains uncompleted after the Effective Date of this Code, will be deemed to have been made under the corresponding provision of this Code and governed by this Code, provided that IMDA is able to determine the proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this Code. Where IMDA is unable to determine a proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this Code, IMDA will notify the parties within 30 days from the Effective Date of this Code and the proceeding shall be deemed withdrawn by the parties. In such an event, the parties may initiate a new proceeding under the corresponding provision of this Code. Where necessary, IMDA may issue directions to the parties of any uncompleted proceeding to specify additional transitional rules for the purpose of determining such proceeding under the corresponding provision of this Code. (b) Where a proceeding commenced under the Code 2008 has been completed before the Effective Date of this Code but any right of appeal is exercised after the Effective Date of this Code, such right of appeal in relation to that proceeding shall be exercised, heard and determined under section 9.7 of this Code. 10.5 Specific Transitional Rules 10.5.1 Classification of Dominant Licensees and Exemptions from Special Provisions Applicable to Dominant Licensees 93 (a) IMDA intends that every Dominant Licensee classification made under the Code 2008 will continue to be in effect and deemed to have been made pursuant to the corresponding provision in this Code. However, where IMDA considers it appropriate to do so, it may for the purpose of clarity and without affecting the validity of any existing classification, by notice on the IMDA website ( ) or by any other means of publication as IMDA considers appropriate, specify the Licensees that are classified as dominant. (b) Except as otherwise provided, and so far as is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code, IMDA intends that every exemption granted to a Dominant Licensee under the Code 2008 will continue to be in effect and deemed to have been granted in respect of, and constitute an exemption from, the corresponding provision in this Code. However, where IMDA considers it appropriate to do so, it may for the purpose of clarity and without affecting the validity of any existing exemption, by notice on the IMDA website ( ) or by any other means of publication as IMDA considers appropriate, specify the corresponding provision of this Code from which a Dominant Licensee is exempted. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, it will not be necessary for IMDA to seek any comment, or initiate any process for Dominant Licensee classification or exemption, provided for in this Code prior to issuing any notification under this section 10.5.1. 10.5.2 RAO and RAO-based Agreements Subject to the requirements of this section, in relation to a Mandated Licensee’s RAO that has been approved by IMDA based on the requirements of the Code 2008, the RAO will continue in effect and will be deemed to have been approved by IMDA under the corresponding provisions of this Code. 94 APPENDIX",en,831
427,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,": (i) in relation to a Request for Enforcement under section 9.2.1, make all relevant allegations of contravention; 87 (ii) in relation to a Response to a Request for Enforcement under section 9.2.1.5 or a response under section 9.2.2.2, raise all relevant grounds to dispute the allegations of contravention; and (iii) in relation to a petition for dispute resolution and a response to a petition for dispute resolution, raise all relevant issues in dispute and submit all relevant information to substantiate the person’s position taken on the issues in dispute. (b) IMDA will reject the relevant portion of any subsequent submission made by the person in the course of the relevant proceeding that: (i) in relation to an enforcement proceeding, makes any new allegation of contravention not previously disclosed in the Request for Enforcement or raises any new ground to dispute the allegations of contravention not previously disclosed in the response; (ii) in relation to a dispute resolution proceeding, raises any new issue in dispute not previously disclosed in the petition for dispute resolution or response to the petition for dispute resolution; (iii) contains information that could have been submitted in its initial submission; or (iv) takes any position that is inconsistent with its initial submission. 9.4 Request for Information (a) In carrying out its duties and functions under this Code, IMDA may, by notice in writing, require a Licensee or other person specified in this Code to produce specified documents or to provide specified information by a specified timeframe. IMDA may also request a person to participate in an interview or require a person to allow IMDA to physically inspect its accounts, documents, records, facilities and operations. (b) All information submitted to IMDA by any Licensee or other person pursuant to the provisions of this Code must, to the best of 88 that Licensee’s or person’s ability and knowledge, be accurate, complete and responsive. At the time it submits the information, the Licensee or person must submit a statement in a form acceptable to IMDA, certifying that it has satisfied this obligation. 9.4.1 Effect of Failure to Submit Required Information (a) In any proceeding under this Code, if a person fails or refuses to submit information required by this Code, or requested by IMDA, within the timeframe specified, IMDA will base its decision on the information provided by any other person who is a party to the proceeding (if any) and on the best information available to IMDA from whatever source derived. (b) Where a person requesting IMDA to take a particular action fails to respond accurately and completely to IMDA’s information request within the timeframe specified, IMDA may refuse to take the action requested. (c) Any failure by a Licensee to comply with IMDA's information requests, and any destruction, disposal, falsification or concealment of requested documents, constitutes a contravention of this Code for which IMDA can take enforcement action pursuant to section 9.2.4. 9.5 Confidential Treatment of Information A person submitting information to IMDA, whether voluntarily, or pursuant to the requirements of this Code or a request from IMDA, may request that the information submitted be treated as confidential. Where feasible, all information for which a person is seeking confidential treatment must be provided in a separate annex. Alternatively, the requesting party must identify the specific document, or portion thereof, or other information for which confidential treatment is sought. IMDA generally will not accept requests to treat all information submitted as confidential. Parties should take reasonable measures to minimise the amount of information for which they request confidential treatment. 9.5.1 Standards Governing Grant of Confidential Treatment (a) IMDA will grant a request for confidential treatment if the requesting party demonstrates, with reasonable specificity, that the information for which it requests confidential treatment contains commercially sensitive information (including information that is subject to a pre-existing non-disclosure agreement with a third 89 party), or that the disclosure of the information would have a material adverse impact. (b) IMDA considers information to be commercially sensitive if: (i) it is not otherwise available to the public; or (ii) there is a reasonable possibility that its disclosure would cause harm to the requesting party or otherwise provide a commercial benefit to the requesting party’s competitors. (c) IMDA will generally find that information that describes the disclosing party’s business procedures, practices, plans or its assessment of market conditions or similar matters is commercially sensitive. 9.5.2 Notification of Denial of Confidential Treatment (a) If IMDA rejects a request for confidential treatment, IMDA will provide the person that submitted the information with the reason for its decision. Within 7 days from the date of IMDA’s rejection of the request for confidential treatment of information, the requesting party may either: (i) request IMDA in writing to return the information, in which case unless the information is otherwise generally available to the public, IMDA will not consider this information in relation to the proceeding; or (ii) withdraw in writing its request for confidential treatment of information, in which case IMDA may consider, and where appropriate, disclose the information provided. (b) If the requesting party fails to do either of the above within the specified period, IMDA will deem the requesting party to have withdrawn its request for confidential treatment of information, in which case IMDA may consider, and where appropriate disclose, the information provided. (c) IMDA’s decision not to grant confidential treatment does not excuse a person from complying fully with any obligation that it may have to provide complete and accurate information to IMDA. 9.6 Consultation with Other Interested Parties 90 In addition to obtaining information directly from the parties to a proceeding under this Code, IMDA may, where appropriate, conduct a public consultation to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on any proceeding. In those cases in which IMDA does not conduct a public consultation, IMDA may nonetheless request comments from individuals or entities where appropriate. IMDA does not assume any obligation to consider any unsolicited comments. 9.7 Appeal to Minister (a) Any Licensee that is aggrieved by, inter alia: (i) any decision of IMDA in the exercise of any discretion vested in it under the Act, including (without limitation) any decision under section 9 of the Act; or (ii) anything contained in any direction given by IMDA under section 25, 26D or 26F(2) of the Act, may appeal to the Minister within 14 days of being notified of the decision or direction in accordance with sections 56(1) and (3) of the Act. (b) Any person (other than a Licensee) that is aggrieved by, inter alia, any decision or direction of IMDA given by or under section 9 (1), 26B or 26D of the Act may appeal to the Minister within 14 days of being notified of the decision or direction in accordance with sections 56(2) and (3) of the Act. (c) Under section 56(6) of the Act, unless otherwise provided, where an appeal is lodged under section 56 of the Act, the decision, direction or other thing being appealed against shall be complied with until the determination of the appeal. (d) In considering whether to stay the effectiveness of a decision or direction pending review, IMDA generally will consider factors including the merits of the appeal, whether the potential harm to any person outweighs the benefits of allowing the decision or direction to go into effect and the public interest. 91 10 REVOCATION, SAVINGS AND TRANSITIONAL 10.1 Introduction 10.1.1 Application All provisions in this section apply to all Licensees. 10.1.2 Over-view This section sets out the savings provisions and transitional rules governing the implementation of the provisions of this Code. 10.2 Revocation",en,1122
428,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may issue a warning to the Licensee. The warning will contain a statement of IMDA’s basis for concluding that the Licensee has acted in contravention of any provision of this Code, but will impose no further sanction. 9.2.4.2 Directions to Cease and Desist Where appropriate, IMDA will direct the Licensee to cease engaging in conduct that is, or if continued will constitute, a contravention of any provision of this Code. 9.2.4.3 Remedial Actions Where appropriate, IMDA will direct the Licensee to take specific remedial action. 9.2.4.4 Financial Penalties (a) IMDA may impose financial penalties of up to $1 million per contravention on the Licensee that contravenes any provision of this Code. 85 (b) In imposing financial penalties, IMDA will consider any aggravating factors. These factors include: (i) whether the contravention was serious; (ii) whether the contravention continued for an extended period; (iii) whether the contravention resulted in harm to third parties; (iv) whether the Licensee acted willfully, recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner; (v) whether the Licensee has a previous history of contraventions; and (vi) whether the Licensee made any effort to conceal the contravention. (c) In imposing financial penalties, IMDA will also consider any mitigating factors. These factors include: (i) whether the contravention was minor; (ii) whether the adverse consequences to third parties from the contravention were minor; (iii) whether the Licensee took prompt action to correct the contravention; (iv) whether the contravention was accidental; and (v) whether the Licensee voluntarily disclosed the contravention to IMDA and co-operated with IMDA in its investigation. 9.2.5 Suspension or Cancellation of the Licence under the Act In serious cases, where IMDA is satisfied that a Licensee has contravened, and is likely to again contravene, any provision of this Code, IMDA may, instead of taking any of the enforcement action specified in section 9.2.4, cancel or suspend the relevant licence under section 9 of the Act. 86 9.2.6 Timeliness of Enforcement Actions (a) The following time limits must be complied with in respect of every enforcement action: (i) in any case in which a person files a Request for Enforcement pursuant to section 9.2.1, the person must do so within 2 years after the date of the occurrence of the action that constitutes the alleged contravention of this Code; and (ii) in any case in which IMDA initiates enforcement action on its own motion, IMDA will issue the written notification provided for in section 9.2.2.1 within 2 years after the date of the occurrence of the action that constitutes the alleged contravention of this Code. (b) In determining the date of the occurrence of the action that constitutes the alleged contravention of this Code, the following will apply: (i) where the alleged contravention could not reasonably have been discovered at the time it was committed, the earlier of the dates on which the conduct was, or reasonably should have been, discovered will constitute the date on which the alleged contravention occurred; or (ii) where a Licensee engages in an on-going course of conduct that allegedly contravenes this Code, the date of the most recent action taken as part of that course of conduct will constitute the date on which the alleged contravention occurred. For example, where conduct undertaken pursuant to an agreement is continuing, IMDA may bring an enforcement action while the conduct is continuing or at the latest, within 2 years from the date on which the Licensee ceases its conduct under the Agreement. 9.3 Binding Effect of Initial Submissions (a) Any person who is a party to an enforcement or dispute resolution proceeding under this Code must, in its initial submission to",en,527
429,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will carefully consider the matters set out in the responses submitted by the Licensee before issuing its decision.

(d) Where IMDA declines to take enforcement action, IMDA will notify the Party Requesting Enforcement and provide a written explanation. 9.2.1.3 Deferment of Consideration for Requests for Enforcement In an appropriate case, IMDA may defer its consideration of a Request for Enforcement.

A copy of the written notification will be made available to the Party Requesting Enforcement. The written notification will clearly indicate the specific provisions of this Code that the Responding Licensee has been alleged to contravene and reasonable details of the alleged facts constituting the contravention. IMDA will also provide the Responding Licensee a copy of the Request for Enforcement and all supporting documents submitted by the Party Requesting Enforcement unless, and to the extent that, IMDA has granted an application by the Party Requesting Enforcement for confidential treatment of information pursuant to section 9.5. 9.2.1.5 Opportunity to Respond Where IMDA accepts the Request for Enforcement and issues a written notification to the Responding Licensee, the Responding Licensee will have 15 days from the date of IMDA’s written notification to submit its Response to IMDA.

IMDA has discretion to determine whether it will conduct any enforcement action. Whilst the enforcement process is designed to provide a significant deterrent to impermissible conduct, any enforcement action taken by IMDA will be proportionate to the severity of the contravention. 9.2.1 Requests for Enforcement by a Private Party Any person that has been injured, or is likely to be injured, as a direct result of the contravention of any provision of this Code by a Licensee, may submit a Request for Enforcement.

(b) In section 9, unless the context otherwise requires: (i) “Party Requesting Enforcement” means a person that submits a Request for Enforcement; (ii) “Request for Enforcement” means a written request asking",en,168

(c) Pursuant to sections 26D(3) and (4) of the Act, IMDA may, in the circumstances specified in those sections, direct: (i) the Designated Postal Licensee to do all or any of the following: (A) to restrict the voting power in respect of the Shares through which an Acquiring Party holds or controls in the Designated Postal Licensee, unless IMDA expressly permits such rights to be exercised; (B) to restrict the issuance or offer of Shares in the Designated Postal Licensee (whether by way of rights, bonus or otherwise) in respect of the Shares specified in paragraph (A), unless IMDA expressly permits such issue or offer; and (C) except in a liquidation of the Designated Postal Licensee, to restrict the payment of any amount (whether by way of dividends or otherwise) in respect of the Shares specified in paragraph (A), unless IMDA expressly authorises such payments subject to such conditions as IMDA may specify; (ii) any Acquiring Party or an Associate of the Acquiring Party to transfer or dispose of all or any part of the Shares specified in paragraph (i) (A) within such time and subject to such conditions as IMDA considers appropriate; and (iii) any Acquiring Party to transfer or dispose of all or any part of the business acquired from the Designated Postal Licensee within such time and subject to such conditions as",en,268

(b) Without prejudice to section 1.4.5, where appropriate, IMDA will provide the public with an opportunity to comment on a Consolidation Application. In those cases in which IMDA seeks public comment in connection with a Consolidation, it will release the non-confidential portions of the detailed statement specified in section 8.5.4 (a) (iv). IMDA will consider all comments received to be public documents, and will make them available on the IMDA website. However, a commenting party may seek confidential treatment of specific information that is proprietary or commercially sensitive by submitting a separate confidential appendix. In those cases in which IMDA does not conduct a public consultation, IMDA may nonetheless request comments from individuals or entities where appropriate. IMDA does not assume any obligation to consider any unsolicited comments. 8.11 Failure to Seek IMDA’s Approval (a) Pursuant to section 26D(9) of the Act and regulation 9 of the Regulations, where an Acquiring Party fails to obtain IMDA’s approval and thereby contravenes section 26B(2), (3) or (4) of the Act and it was not aware that it had contravened the provision in question, it shall: (i) notify IMDA in writing of the contravention within 14 days of becoming aware of the contravention; (ii) provide IMDA with such information as IMDA may require for the purpose of determining what directions to give to the 75 Acquiring Party under section 26D of the Act, including (without limitation): (A) an explanation of why it contravened section 26B(2), (3) or (4) of the Act, as the case may be; and (B) the information specified in section 8.4.4 or 8.5.4, as the case may be; and (iii) where the Acquiring Party has contravened section 26B(3) or (4) of the Act, pay to IMDA the application fee specified in section 8.5.4 (b).

444,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may impose other conditions that are designed to preserve or increase competition or meet public interest objectives. These include, but are not limited to, conditions designed to increase entry into Basic Letter Services Markets that are not yet fully competitive. 8.10 Requests for Information and Public Consultation (a) Without prejudice to sections 25, 26E and 46 of the Act, where",en,55
445,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may require any of the Applicants to agree to divest certain assets to an acceptable purchaser in an arm’s length transaction. In order for a voluntary partial divestiture to constitute an adequate remedy, the Applicants must agree to the following provisions: (a) the divestiture must involve the sale of sufficient assets to eliminate the risk that the Consolidation will create, preserve or increase the Post-Consolidation Entity’s ability to substantially lessen competition; and (b) the divestiture must be made to an entity that, in IMDA’s reasonable opinion, has the ability and incentive to operate the divested assets as a viable, competitive business. 8.9.5 Validity of Approval (a) IMDA may require the transaction to which a Request or Consolidation Application relates to be legally completed within one year from the date of IMDA’s written approval, failing which the approval will cease to be valid. In exceptional cases, IMDA may specify a longer validity period for its approval. IMDA will consider requests from Applicants for an extension of the validity period of its approval on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must provide IMDA with strong justification why they require the extension and must satisfy IMDA that the basis on which the approval was granted will remain applicable throughout the period of extension. (b) If there is any material change affecting any basis on which IMDA previously approved a Request or Consolidation Application and the transaction related to such Request or Consolidation Application remains uncompleted, the parties must immediately notify IMDA in writing with full disclosure of the change in circumstances and seek IMDA’s decision on the continued validity of the earlier approval granted. In such a situation, IMDA’s earlier approval will continue to be valid unless IMDA notifies the parties to submit a new Request or Consolidation Application incorporating the changed circumstances. 74 8.9.6 Other Conditions",en,269
446,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may require the Applicants to agree that the Designated Postal Licensee or the Post-Consolidation Entity will conduct certain operations 73 through a structurally separate entity.

IMDA may require the Applicants to agree that the Designated Postal Licensee or the Post-Consolidation Entity will contract for independent audits to confirm compliance or to periodically self-certify its compliance with such conditions. 8.9.3 Structural Separation",en,87

449,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," 8.7.1 sets out the applicable procedures for mandatory offers, voluntary offers and partial offers under the Take-over Code. 8.7.1.1 Partial Offers That Do Not Amount to a Consolidation (a) Where an Acquiring Party intends to make a partial offer under rule 16 of the Take-over Code that would result in the Acquiring Party becoming a 12% Controller of a Designated Postal Licensee, the Licensee and the Acquiring Party shall, after the Acquiring Party 70 announces its pre-conditional offer (i.e. makes an announcement that a partial offer will be made only after IMDA’s approval has been obtained) and not less than 60 days before making the offer), submit a Request to IMDA in accordance with section 8.4.3. (b) In the event that IMDA does not grant its approval within 60 days of the submission of the Request, the Acquiring Party shall not proceed to make its offer until such time as IMDA may grant its approval. 8.7.1.2 Voluntary Offers or Partial Offers That Amount to a Consolidation (a) Where an Acquiring Party intends to make a voluntary offer or a partial offer under rules 15 and 16 respectively of the Take-over Code that would result in the Acquiring Party becoming a 30% Controller of a Designated Postal Licensee or entering into a Consolidation with a Designated Postal Licensee, the Acquiring Party and the Designated Postal Licensee shall, after the Acquiring Party announces its offer (i.e. makes an announcement that a voluntary offer or partial offer will be made only after IMDA’s approval has been obtained) and not less than 60 days before it makes its offer, submit a Consolidation Application in accordance with section 8.5.3. (b) In the event that IMDA does not grant its approval within 60 days of the submission of the Consolidation Application, the Acquiring Party shall not proceed to make its offer until such time as IMDA may grant its approval. 8.7.1.3 Mandatory Offers No Acquiring Party shall enter into any transaction for the acquisition of shares in a Designated Postal Licensee that will trigger a mandatory offer under rule 14 of the Take-over Code, unless the completion of such transaction is conditional upon the Acquiring Party and Designated Postal Licensee obtaining IMDA’s prior written approval under section 26B of the Act, not less than 60 days before the Acquiring Party proceeds to make such offer. 8.7.2 Other Tender Offers Where the rules of the securities exchange on which a Designated Postal Licensee’s Shares are traded conflict with the procedures specified in section 8.7, or where the provisions of section 8.7 do not address any specific situation in connection with a Tender Offer, the Acquiring Party 71 must seek IMDA’s guidance as to the appropriate course of action and procedures to be followed to obtain IMDA’s approval. Nothing in this paragraph shall exempt an Acquiring Party from complying with Part IVA of the Act and the Regulations including, without limitation, the requirement under regulation 7 of the Regulations to obtain IMDA’s approval not less than 60 days before making an offer for the Voting Shares of a Designated Postal Licensee. 8.8 Additional Procedures Relating to Share Buybacks (a) Subject to paragraph (b), a Designated Postal Licensee need not seek IMDA’s approval to carry out a Share Buyback. (b) Before entering into any transaction for a Share Buyback, a Designated Postal Licensee must calculate the percentage of Voting Shares held by each shareholder following completion of the Share Buyback. If, as a result of the Share Buyback: (i) any shareholder who previously held less than 5% of the total number of Voting Shares in the Designated Postal Licensee, or had control of less than 5% of the voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee would, after the transaction, hold 5% or more, but less than 12% of the total Voting Shares in the Designated Postal Licensee, or control 5% or more but less than 12% of the voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee, the Designated Postal Licensee may proceed with the Share Buyback and shall file the appropriate notification under section 8.3; (ii) any shareholder will become a 12% Controller of the Designated Postal Licensee, the Designated Postal Licensee and the shareholder must seek IMDA’s approval before the Designated Postal Licensee proceeds with the Share Buyback; and (iii) any shareholder will enter into a Consolidation with the Designated Postal Licensee, the Designated Postal Licensee and the shareholder must seek IMDA’s approval before the Designated Postal Licensee proceeds with the Share Buyback. (c) For the purposes of paragraph (b), the Designated Postal Licensee shall notify shareholders who are required to seek IMDA’s approval in accordance with that paragraph, and the Designated Postal Licensee and the relevant shareholders shall, as the case may 72 be, submit a Request in accordance with section 8.4.3 or a Consolidation Application in accordance with section 8.5.3. 8.9 Conditions of Approval",en,723
450,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017, 8.7 sets out the additional procedures to be followed where an Acquiring Party intends to make a Tender Offer. 8.7.1 Tender Offers under the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers,en,28

If the Applicants choose to propose such conditions, they should provide a complete description of the proposed conditions and an assessment of why such conditions would be adequate to address any competitive concern that might arise from the Consolidation. (b) Each Consolidation Application must be accompanied by payment of an application fee of $5,000, to be paid by the Acquiring Party. (c) Until IMDA issues its written decision on whether to approve or deny a Consolidation Application, the Applicants must promptly inform IMDA in writing of any new or different fact or matter that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on IMDA’s consideration of the Consolidation Application. 8.5.5 Separate Filing and Direct Submission of Information (a) Without prejudice to regulation 11 of the Regulations, an Applicant may apply in writing to IMDA for a waiver of the requirement for the Applicant to submit a joint Consolidation Application with other Applicants if the Applicant can establish that: (i) it is unable to comply with the requirement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control; or (ii) requiring it to comply with the requirement would be unduly burdensome or would prejudice its legitimate commercial interests. (b) Circumstances under which IMDA may grant a waiver under paragraph (a) include (without limitation) the following: 68 (i) where an Acquiring Party reasonably believes that a Designated Postal Licensee is likely to be opposed to its acquisition of Voting Shares or control of voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee or to the Acquiring Party entering into a Consolidation with the Designated Postal Licensee; (ii) where an Applicant reasonably believes that the filing of a joint Consolidation Application would be unduly burdensome or infeasible; or (iii) where an Applicant can demonstrate that the other party has refused to cooperate with it to file a joint Consolidation Application. (c) Where an Applicant does not want to disclose confidential, commercially sensitive or proprietary information to the other Applicant for inclusion in a Consolidation Application, IMDA may allow the Applicant to submit its confidential, commercially sensitive or proprietary information directly to IMDA but the Applicant shall otherwise submit a joint Consolidation Application with other Applicants containing such other information as may be required under this Code. (d) Where IMDA grants permission for separate filing of a Consolidation Application under paragraph (a) in cases where more than one Acquiring Party requires IMDA’s approval for a particular transaction, no additional application fee shall be payable but all Acquiring Parties shall be jointly liable for the stipulated application fee. 8.5.6 Approval or Denial of Consolidation Applications (a) IMDA will deny a Consolidation Application where IMDA determines that the Consolidation to which the Consolidation Application relates is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in any Basic Letter Services Market or it is in the public interest to deny the Consolidation Application. (b) If IMDA denies a Consolidation Application, IMDA will provide a written statement of the reasons for its denial. (c) IMDA may approve a Consolidation Application with or without Conditions. Without prejudice to section 26D of the Act, IMDA 69 may issue a direction under section 26D(3) or (4) of the Act (described in section 8.12 of this Code) in the event that any Condition is not complied with. 8.6 Associated Acquiring Parties (a) For the avoidance of doubt, where an Acquiring Party enters into a transaction that requires IMDA’s approval under section 26B of the Act, other Acquiring Parties that are Associates of the Acquiring Party may also require IMDA’s approval. In such a case, all the Acquiring Parties (including the first-mentioned Acquiring Party and Acquiring Parties that are its Associates) and the Designated Postal Licensee must jointly submit a single Request or Consolidation Application to IMDA, as the case may be. (b) For example, without limitation, in the situation where Entity A acquires the Voting Shares in a Designated Postal Licensee and that Entity A is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entity B, then in such a case both Entities A and B would be Acquiring Parties under section 26B of the Act. This is because the Entity A would have acquired Voting Shares in the Designated Postal Licensee, whereas Entity B would have acquired control of voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee. Accordingly, if the acquisition of Voting Shares by Entity A and control of voting power by Entity B cross the relevant thresholds of a 12% Controller or 30% Controller, then both entities together with the Designated Postal Licensee, must jointly submit a single Request or Consolidation Application to IMDA, as the case may be. 8.7 Additional Procedures Relating to Tender Offers",en,704

(c) If requested by IMDA in writing, the Designated Postal Licensee must notify IMDA within 5 Working Days of each further acquisition by the Acquiring Party of Voting Shares or control of voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee. Such written notifications must state the percentage of the Voting Shares or voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee that the Acquiring Party held or controlled prior to the acquisition and the percentage of Voting Shares or voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee that the Acquiring Party has further acquired. 8.5.2 Determining the Existence of a Consolidation (a) A Consolidation may involve: (i) the acquisition of Voting Shares or control of voting power of 30% or more in a Designated Postal Licensee, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or otherwise; (ii) obtaining the ability to exercise Effective Control over a Designated Postal Licensee; (iii) the acquisition of the business of a Designated Postal Licensee (or any part thereof) as a going concern; or 62 (iv) any transaction or class of transactions that is prescribed by regulations made under section 26H of the Act.

455,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will presume that an Acquiring Party that becomes a 12% Controller of a Designated Postal Licensee is not likely to have the ability to exercise Effective Control over that Designated Postal Licensee. Therefore, IMDA will presume that an acquisition of Voting Shares or control of voting power in a Designated Postal Licensee of 12% or more but less than 30%, is not likely to constitute a Consolidation. However, in certain circumstances, an Acquiring Party that acquires Voting Shares or control of voting power in this range could have the ability to use its Voting Shares or voting power in a manner that would substantially lessen competition or in a manner that is contrary to the public interest. For example, a Licensee that has Voting Shares or voting power of 12% or more but less than 30% in each of 2 Competing Licensees could use its Voting Shares or voting power to facilitate anti-competitive coordination between the 2 Competing Licensees. 8.4.3 Procedures to Seek Prior Approval (a) An Acquiring Party may acquire Voting Shares or control of voting power in a Designated Postal Licensee that would result in the Acquiring Party becoming a 12% Controller of the Designated Postal Licensee by various means.

(b) Every Acquiring Party, the Designated Postal Licensee and Associate of the Acquiring Party (as may be required by IMDA) must jointly submit a Request to IMDA in respect of the Acquiring Party becoming a 12% Controller of the Designated Postal Licensee.

(c) In the event that IMDA does not grant its approval within 60 days of the submission of the Request, the Acquiring Party shall not proceed to become a 12% Controller of a Designated Postal Licensee until such time as IMDA may grant its approval. (d) For transactions relating to a Tender Offer, the Acquiring Party and the Designated Postal Licensee must submit a Request in accordance with section 8.7. 58 8.4.4 Information and Documents to be Included in a Request (a) Each Request shall contain all the required information reasonably necessary for IMDA to determine the likely impact of the acquisition on competition and the public interest, including (without limitation) the following documents and information (based on the Applicants’ reasonable and diligent efforts to collect and provide such information): (i) the names, addresses and contact information of the Acquiring Party and the Designated Postal Licensee; (ii) the names, addresses and contact information of all Associates and Affiliates of the Designated Postal Licensee, and all Associates and Affiliates of the Acquiring Party; (iii) the percentage of Voting Shares or voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee that the Acquiring Party holds or held (if any) prior to the proposed acquisition or acquisition, as the case may be; (iv) the percentage of Voting Shares or voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee that the Acquiring Party proposes to acquire or has acquired; (v) the percentage of Voting Shares or voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee that the Acquiring Party will hold or control if the Request is approved; (vi) a description of the Postal Services provided by the Acquiring Party, the Designated Postal Licensee and their respective Associates and Affiliates, and their estimated market shares thereof; (vii) any special or preferential rights granted or that will be granted to the Acquiring Party if the Request is approved; and (viii) any anticipated significant changes in management or operations of the Designated Postal Licensee. (b) Until IMDA issues its written decision on whether to approve or deny a Request, the Applicants must promptly inform IMDA in writing of any new or different fact or matter that is reasonably 59 likely to have a material impact on IMDA’s consideration of the Request. 8.4.5 Separate Filing and Direct Submission of Information (a) Without prejudice to regulation 11 of the Regulations, an Applicant may apply in writing to IMDA for a waiver of the requirement for the Applicant to submit a joint Request with other Applicants if the Applicant can establish that: (i) it is unable to comply with the requirement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control; or (ii) requiring it to comply with the requirement would be unduly burdensome or would prejudice its legitimate commercial interests. (b) Circumstances under which IMDA may grant a waiver under paragraph (a) include (without limitation) the following: (i) where an Acquiring Party reasonably believes that a Designated Postal Licensee is likely to be opposed to its acquisition of Voting Shares or control of voting power in the Designated Postal Licensee; (ii) where an Applicant reasonably believes that the submission of a joint Request would be unduly burdensome or infeasible; or (iii) where an Applicant can demonstrate that the other Applicant has refused to cooperate with it to submit a joint Request.

(b) If IMDA denies a Request, IMDA will provide a written statement of the reasons for its denial. (c) In those cases in which: (i) a Designated Postal Licensee and an Acquiring Party have filed a Request in connection with a proposed acquisition of Voting Shares or control of voting power that would result in the Acquiring Party becoming a 12% Controller of the Designated Postal Licensee; and (ii) IMDA determines that the transaction constitutes a Consolidation,",en,1367

In some cases, the Acquiring Party may seek to acquire sufficiently significant Voting Shares or control of voting power, or engage in other transactions, that result in the Designated Postal Licensee ceasing to operate as a separate economic entity. In many cases, such transactions can have pro- competitive effects, such as creating economies of scale and scope. In other cases, however, such transactions may harm competition. For example, such transactions could create an entity that is not subject to competitive market forces or could facilitate unlawful collusion among Competing Licensees.

462,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,"supply chain”, such as Vertical Agreements, may sometimes raise competitive concerns, especially where one of the parties to the agreement has Significant Market Power. 7.5.1 General Prohibition Licensees are prohibited from entering into Non-horizontal Agreements with entities (whether licensed or not), which unreasonably restrict, or are likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. 7.5.2 Agreements will be Assessed Based on an Individualised Assessment of their Actual or Likely Competitive Effect (a) IMDA will assess the permissibility of any Non-horizontal Agreement based on its actual or likely effect on competition. (b) In assessing whether a Non-horizontal Agreement unreasonably restricts competition, or is likely to unreasonably restrict competition, in a Basic Letter Services market, IMDA will consider both the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of the agreement. IMDA will only find that a Non-horizontal Agreement unreasonably restricts competition, or is likely to 44 unreasonably restrict competition, if IMDA concludes that the actual or likely anti-competitive effects of the agreement outweigh the actual or likely pro-competitive effects of the agreement. (c) IMDA will be more likely to find that a Non-horizontal Agreement contravenes the Code if IMDA determines that the agreement is a Vertical Agreement that involves an entity, whether or not a Licensee, that has Significant Market Power in a relevant market. 45 8 ACQUISITIONS AND CONSOLIDATIONS INVOLVING",en,195
463,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will assess whether an agreement contravenes the Code based on its likely or actual competitive effect. If IMDA determines that an agreement contravenes the Code, it may: (i) direct the Licensee to revise the agreement to eliminate the contravening terms or terminate the agreement; and/or (ii) take any other appropriate enforcement action. (b) In section 7, unless the context otherwise requires: (i) “Horizontal Agreement” means an agreement between or among Competing Licensees; (ii) “Non-horizontal Agreement” means an agreement between a Licensee and another entity that is not a Competing Licensee; and (iii) “Vertical Agreement” means an agreement between a Licensee and a supplier or a distributor. 7.2 Determining the Existence of Agreements (a) For the purposes of section 7, an agreement can be established in any of 3 ways: (i) an agreement can be established through direct evidence of an express agreement, such as a signed document; 39 (ii) an agreement can also be established using circumstantial evidence that demonstrates the existence of an express agreement. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that a Licensee has engaged in certain conduct that provides a reasonable basis to infer that the Licensee entered into an agreement; or (iii) an agreement may be tacit (i.e., even in the absence of an actual agreement, Licensees may co-ordinate their production and pricing decisions in order to reduce aggregate output and raise market prices). (b) IMDA will not find a tacit agreement where Licensees have done nothing more than make similar output and pricing decisions, which could reflect an efficient response to changing market conditions. Instead, IMDA will only find that there has been a tacit agreement if the Licensees have employed “signalling devices”, such as the sharing of price and output information, and that these devices have facilitated coordinated behaviour. (c) For the purposes of section 7, an arrangement between a Licensee and an Affiliate over which the Licensee can exercise Effective Control does not constitute an agreement. Neither does this section restrict the ability of a Licensee to enter into an arrangement with another entity in which the second entity acts as a bona fide agent of the Licensee. 7.3 Agreements Between Licensees Providing Competing Services (Horizontal Agreements) The following provisions are applicable to Horizontal Agreements. 7.3.1 General Prohibition Licensees are prohibited from entering into Horizontal Agreements that unreasonably restrict, or are likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market. 7.3.2 Specific Prohibited Horizontal Agreements The following types of Horizontal Agreements constitute unreasonable restrictions of competition and are specifically prohibited, even in the absence of evidence of likely or actual anti-competitive effect. 40 7.3.2.1 Price Fixing and Output Restrictions Licensees must not enter into Horizontal Agreements to set the price that one or more Licensees will charge for any Basic Letter Service and/or restrict the total quantity of Basic Letter Services that one or more Licensees will offer, regardless of the levels to which the Licensees agree. 7.3.2.2 Bid Rigging (a) Licensees must not enter into Horizontal Agreements in which they agree not to bid, to bid at specific prices, to bid within a specific price range, or to co-ordinate separate bids for: (i) assets, resources or rights auctioned by IMDA; (ii) any good or service that the Licensees use to provide a Basic Letter Service; or (iii) the provision by the Licensees of any Basic Letter Service. (b) IMDA will find that such agreements contravene the Code regardless of the price levels to which the Licensees agree. 7.3.2.3 Market and Customer Division (a) Licensees must not enter into Horizontal Agreements not to compete to provide a Basic Letter Service to: (i) specific Customers; (ii) any class of Customers; or (iii) Customers in specific geographical areas. (b) IMDA will find that such agreements contravene the Code regardless of the terms and conditions on which the Licensees agree. 7.3.2.4 Group Boycotts Competing Licensees must not agree to refuse to: (a) provide a Basic Letter Service to a specific supplier, Licensee or Customer; or 41 (b) obtain from a specific supplier, Licensee or Customer any good or service that the Licensees use to provide a Basic Letter Service. 7.3.3 Agreements Necessary for Legitimate Collaborative Ventures Nothing in sections 7.3.2 through 7.3.2.4 prohibits agreements among Competing Licensees that are ancillary to efficiency-enhancing integration of economic activity, where such agreements are no broader than necessary to achieve the pro-competitive benefit. Rather, IMDA will assess the permissibility of such agreements, pursuant to sections 7.4 through 7.4.3, based on their actual or likely competitive effect. 7.4 Horizontal Agreements that will be Assessed Based on their Actual or Likely Competitive Effect (a) Unlike the types of agreements described in sections 7.3.2 through 7.3.2.4, many Horizontal Agreements have the potential to increase competition. Such agreements may include agreements to: (i) produce or obtain goods or services used by multiple Licensees to provide Basic Letter Services; (ii) jointly market or provide Basic Letter Services to Customers; or (iii) engage in joint research and development activities. (b) If such Horizontal Agreements are challenged in an enforcement proceeding, IMDA will assess whether the agreements contravene this Code based on their actual or likely effect on competition. (c) Where there is evidence that the Horizontal Agreement actually has unreasonably restricted competition, IMDA will find it to be in contravention of this Code. IMDA will find that a Horizontal Agreement actually has unreasonably restricted competition if the evidence of its competitive effect, taken as a whole, demonstrates that the agreement has: (i) restricted output below the level of demand, increased prices above cost, reduced quality below the level that Customers seek, reduced Customers’ choice or deterred innovation; or (ii) deterred or precluded efficient entities from participating in the market. 42 (d) Where there is no evidence of actual market effect because the Horizontal Agreement is relatively recent, IMDA will determine the permissibility of the agreement by seeking to assess whether it is likely to unreasonably restrict competition. In conducting this assessment, IMDA will consider the factors specified in sections 7.4.1 through 7.4.3. 7.4.1 Business Purpose of the Agreement In reviewing an agreement, IMDA will make a preliminary assessment of its likely competitive impact (i.e. IMDA will attempt to determine whether the agreement is likely to lead to a reduction in output or an increase in prices of Basic Letter Services). If the agreement is between or among a small number of Licensees that do not have Significant Market Power in the relevant market, and the business purpose of the agreement appears to be to increase output and reduce prices, IMDA will generally conclude, without conducting any further analysis, that the agreement does not contravene this Code. 7.4.2 Likelihood of Competitive Harm Where an agreement involves a more significant number of Licensees, or a Licensee that has Significant Market Power in the relevant market, or where an agreement has the potential to result in higher prices or reductions in output of Basic Letter Services, IMDA will conduct a more detailed assessment. In particular, IMDA will consider the following factors: (a) whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Licensees retain the ability to act independently of the agreed-upon venture; (b) the duration of the agreement; (c) whether, in the event the Licensees acted anti-competitively, new entry into the market would be likely, sufficient and timely enough to deter or counteract any competitive harm; and (d) any other factors that help predict the likely competitive effect of the agreement. If, after assessing these factors, IMDA concludes that the agreement poses no risk of competitive harm in any Basic Letter Services market, IMDA will conclude that the agreement does not contravene this Code. 43 7.4.3 Efficiencies If IMDA’s review demonstrates that an agreement has the potential to result in a reduction in output or an increase in prices of Basic Letter Services, IMDA will consider whether the agreement is necessary to achieve efficiencies, which are likely to be passed on to Customers. Such efficiencies could include reductions in the cost of developing, producing, marketing and delivering Basic Letter Services. If such efficiencies offset the potential anti-competitive effect, and could not reasonably be achieved through measures that reduce competition to a lesser extent, IMDA will conclude that the agreement does not contravene this Code. If such efficiencies do not offset the potential anti-competitive effect, or could reasonably be achieved through measures that reduce competition to a lesser extent, IMDA will conclude that the agreement contravenes this Code. 7.5 Agreements Between Licensees and Entities that are Not Direct Competitors (Non-horizontal Agreements) Non-horizontal Agreements generally do not adversely affect competition. In many cases, Non-horizontal Agreements may promote competition. However, agreements that involve entities that are at different levels in the",en,1271
464,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," RESTRICT COMPETITION 7.1 Introduction and Definitions (a) IMDA will not routinely review agreements entered into by Licensees (other than Network Access Agreements). However, pursuant to the procedures in section 9, IMDA may take enforcement action (on its own motion or pursuant to a request from a private party) against any Licensee that enters into an agreement with another Licensee or any non-licensed entity that has the effect of unreasonably restricting competition in any Basic Letter Services market. Certain types of agreements are so clearly anti-competitive that IMDA will determine that a Licensee that has entered into such an agreement has contravened the Code, without conducting an assessment of the likely or actual competitive effect of the agreement. In other cases, however,",en,108
465,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,", either on its own motion or at the request of another person, may initiate an enforcement action pursuant to the procedures set out in section 9. 6.2 Abuse of Dominant Position 6.2.1 General Prohibition A Licensee that has Significant Market Power in any market, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, must not use its dominant position in that market in a manner that unreasonably restricts, or is likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. 6.2.2 Specific Prohibited Conduct Without limiting the generality of section 6.2.1, the following sections provide examples of conduct that constitute an abuse of a dominant position. 6.2.2.1 Pricing Abuses A Licensee with Significant Market Power must not price its services in a manner that unreasonably restricts, or is likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. In particular, the Licensee must not engage in the anti-competitive pricing practices described in sections 6.2.2.1.1 through 6.2.2.1.3. 6.2.2.1.1 Predatory Pricing A Licensee with Significant Market Power must not engage in predatory pricing. IMDA will find that such a Licensee has engaged in predatory pricing if: (a) the Licensee is selling a Basic Letter Service in Singapore at a 34 price that is less than its average incremental cost; (b) the Licensee’s sales at prices below average incremental cost have driven, or are likely to drive, efficient rivals from the market or deter future efficient rivals from entering the market; and (c) entry barriers are so significant that, after driving rivals from the market or deterring entry, the Licensee could impose an increase in prices sufficient (in amount and duration) to enable the Licensee to recoup the full amount of the loss that it incurred during the period of price-cutting. 6.2.2.1.2 Price Squeeze A Licensee with Significant Market Power must not engage in price- squeezing. IMDA will find that such a Licensee has engaged in price- squeezing if: (a) the Licensee provides an input that another Licensee requires in order to provide a competing Basic Letter Service in Singapore; and (b) the price that the Licensee charges for the service is so high that the other Licensee, its Affiliate, or a reasonably efficient non- affiliated Licensee could not profitably sell its Basic Letter Services in Singapore. 6.2.2.1.3 Anti-competitive Cross-subsidisation (a) A Licensee with Significant Market Power must not engage in anti- competitive cross-subsidisation of Basic Letter Services in Singapore. (b) IMDA will find that such a Licensee has engaged in anti- competitive cross-subsidisation if the Licensee uses revenues from the provision of any service that is not subject to effective competition to cross-subsidise the price of any Basic Letter Service in Singapore that is subject to effective competition where this has unreasonably restricted, or is likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. 35 6.2.2.2 Anti-competitive Discrimination A Licensee with Significant Market Power must not engage in anti- competitive discrimination. IMDA will find that such a Licensee has engaged in anti-competitive discrimination if: (a) the Licensee provides any Affiliate with access to infrastructure, systems, services, or information that, as a practical matter, are necessary for non-affiliated Licensees to provide Basic Letter Services in Singapore; and (b) such access is provided on prices, terms or conditions that are more favourable than those the Licensee provides to non-affiliated Licensees without any objective justification, such as verifiable difference in the cost of providing such a service. 6.2.3 Determining the Existence of Significant Market Power (a) IMDA will find that a Licensee has Significant Market Power using the applicable procedures specified below: (i) if, at the time at which the alleged conduct occurred, the Licensee was classified as a Dominant Licensee in the market in which the anti-competitive conduct allegedly occurred, IMDA will presume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Licensee had Significant Market Power in that market. (ii) if, at the time at which the alleged conduct occurred, the Licensee was not classified as a Dominant Licensee in the market in which the anti-competitive conduct allegedly occurred, IMDA will determine whether the Licensee had Significant Market Power using the methodology specified in section 2.5. 6.2.4 Anti-competitive Preferences (a) A Licensee with an Affiliate that has Significant Market Power in any market is prohibited from using the market position of its Affiliate in a manner that enables it to, or is likely to enable it to, unreasonably restrict competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. These Affiliates may include: (i) other postal operators licensed under section 6 of the Act; 36 (ii) non-licensed entities within Singapore; and (iii) non-licensed entities located outside Singapore. (b) In particular, a Licensee must not engage in any of the following practices: (i) if a Licensee uses a service that is provided by an Affiliate that has Significant Market Power in the market for that service, and if another Licensee requires such service in order to provide a Basic Letter Service in Singapore, then the Licensee must not obtain such service at a price that is so high that the other Licensee, its Affiliate, or a reasonably efficient non-affiliated Licensee could not profitably sell its Basic Letter Service in Singapore. (ii) a Licensee may not accept any cross-subsidisation from an Affiliate that has Significant Market Power, where a subsidy received by the Licensee from the Affiliate enables the Licensee to provide a Basic Letter Service in Singapore at a price that has unreasonably restricted, or is likely to unreasonably restrict, competition in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore. (iii) a Licensee with an Affiliate that has Significant Market Power in any market for services that as a practical matter, are necessary to provide a Basic Letter Service in Singapore may not accept access to those services, where such access is provided on prices, terms and conditions that are more favourable than the prices, terms and conditions on which the Affiliate provides those services to non-affiliated Licensees without an objective justification, such as verifiable differences in the cost of providing such a service. 6.3 Unfair Methods of Competition 6.3.1 General Prohibition A Licensee must not engage in any unfair method of competition. An unfair method of competition is an improper practice by which a Licensee seeks to obtain a competitive advantage for itself or an Affiliate in any Basic Letter Services market in Singapore for reasons unrelated to the availability, price or quality of the service that the Licensee or its Affiliate offers. The following sections provide examples of practices that would 37 constitute unfair methods of competition. 6.3.2 Specific Prohibited Practices In particular, a Licensee shall not engage in any of the following activities: 6.3.2.1 Degradation of Service Availability or Quality A Licensee must not take any action, or induce any other person to take any action, that has the effect of degrading the availability or quality of another Licensee’s Basic Letter Service in Singapore or raising the other Licensee’s costs, without a legitimate business, operational or technical justification. 6.3.2.2 Improper Use of Information Regarding a Competing Licensee’s Customers A Licensee that receives information from another Licensee about the other Licensee’s Customers in order to fulfil any duty under this Code must not use that information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided. In particular, the Licensee must not use the information that it receives to market Basic Letter Services in Singapore to the other Licensee’s Customers or otherwise interfere in the other Licensee’s existing relationship with its Customers. 38 7 AGREEMENTS INVOLVING LICENSEES THAT",en,1106

In addition, a Licensee must not engage in conduct that constitutes an unfair method of competition. Where a Licensee engages in such conduct,",en,63
467,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will provide the parties with notice and an opportunity to comment. (c) In any case in which the entire agreement is to be published, IMDA may, on its own motion or at the request of either of the Mandated Licensee or the Requesting Licensee, allow the Mandated Licensee to withhold from publication any portion of a Network Access Agreement if IMDA determines that it contains proprietary or commercially sensitive information. 5.9 Enforcement of Agreements In the event of a dispute arising out of any Network Access Agreement with a Mandated Licensee, either person may request IMDA to resolve the dispute. If IMDA declines to intervene, the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee may resolve the dispute in any mutually agreeable manner. 33 6 ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION AND UNFAIR METHODS OF",en,117
468,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will have 15 days to either approve the Network Access Agreement or to direct the parties to amend the agreement by including provisions specified by IMDA that fully implement its decision. 5.8 Publication of Network Access Agreements (a) For any Network Access Agreement entered into by a Mandated Licensee, the Mandated Licensee must publish on its website (or in such other manner as may be specified by IMDA) either: (i) a summary of the agreement, which at a minimum, must include a service description, along with prices (including any discount structures), service suspension and termination provisions (including any early termination charges), service availability and eligibility requirement offered by the Mandated Licensee; or (ii) the entire agreement. 32 (b) IMDA reserves the right to require the Mandated Licensee to publish the entire Network Access Agreement. Before doing so,",en,121
469,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," to resolve the dispute. 5.7.2.1 Scope of the Dispute Resolution Process Provided that they do not unreasonably discriminate against any other Licensee, IMDA will not re-open any issue on which the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee have reached agreement. Instead, the dispute resolution will be limited to those issues on which the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee are unable to reach agreement. 31 5.7.2.2 Standards to be Applied To the extent that an issue in dispute is addressed by the prices, terms and conditions of the Mandated Licensee’s approved RAO, IMDA will apply those provisions. To the extent that an issue in dispute is not addressed by the RAO, IMDA may impose any appropriate resolution (including resolutions not advocated by either the Mandated Licensee or the Requesting Licensee). 5.7.2.3 Implementation of Dispute Resolution Decision by Mandated Licensee or Requesting Licensee (a) Within 15 days of the date on which IMDA issues its decision, the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee must either: (i) submit to IMDA an Individualised Access Agreement that complies with the decision; or (ii) inform IMDA that either one or both of the Mandated Licensee or the Requesting Licensee no longer wants to enter into an Individualised Access Agreement. (b) In any case in which the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee submit a revised Individualised Access Agreement,",en,198
470,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,". If IMDA takes no action within 21 days after the agreement is submitted to it, the agreement will be deemed approved. IMDA will only reject a voluntary Individualised Access Agreement if it determines that the agreement discriminates unreasonably against any other Licensee. (b) In any case in which IMDA rejects an Individualised Access Agreement, it will direct the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee to make the necessary changes. In such cases, the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee must make the required changes, unless both the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee agree to withdraw the Individualised Access Agreement. 5.7.2 Agreements Arrived at via Dispute Resolution If the Mandated Licensee and Requesting Licensees fail to voluntarily reach agreement regarding the Individualised Access Agreement within 90 days of the date on which the Requesting Licensee submitted its request, either the Mandated Licensee or the Requesting Licensee may request",en,132
471,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," into compliance with IMDA’s requirements. The Mandated Licensee will have 30 days from the date on which IMDA provides notification to submit a revised proposed RAO that incorporates the modifications required by IMDA. Within 30 days from the date on which IMDA receives the revised proposed RAO, IMDA will approve the RAO, direct the Mandated Licensee to incorporate specific language, or notify the Mandated Licensee that IMDA requires additional time for its review. (c) A Mandated Licensee must notify IMDA and obtain IMDA’s written approval before making any changes to its RAO. (d) IMDA may at any time serve a notice to the Mandated Licensee to review or modify the RAO, in whole or in part, on its own initiative. In each case, IMDA will seek public comments prior to adopting any modification. 30 5.7 Network Access Pursuant to an Individualised Access Agreement A Requesting Licensee may seek to enter into an Individualised Access Agreement with a Mandated Licensee through the parties’ voluntary negotiations, and if unable to do so, via the dispute resolution process specified in sections 5.7.2 through 5.7.2.3. Licensees are free to enter into an Individualised Access Agreement on any mutually agreeable prices, terms and conditions, provided that they do not unreasonably discriminate against any other Licensee. 5.7.1 IMDA Review (a) The Individualised Access Agreement must specify that it will be submitted to, and will not become effective until approved by,",en,210
472,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," and terminate any Network Access Agreement adopted pursuant to its RAO, any Network Access Agreement arrived at by accepting the RAO shall be effective for such period as the Mandated Licensee is required to offer the RAO to Requesting Licensees; and (b) the prices, terms and conditions contained in any Network Access Agreement arrived at by accepting the RAO will be effective for the duration of the Network Access Agreement unless one of the following occurs: (i) the Mandated Licensee and Requesting Licensee agree to 29 modify their Network Access Agreement. In this case, the parties’ Network Access Agreement will be treated as an Individualised Access Agreement. The Agreement may not go into effect until approved by IMDA, pursuant to section 5.7.1 (a); or (ii) IMDA directs the Mandated Licensee to modify any provision of its RAO, or approves a modification proposed by the Mandated Licensee. In this case, the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee must amend the Network Access Agreement to conform to the modifications in the RAO. 5.6.6 IMDA Review of the Proposed RAO (a) IMDA will review the proposed RAO to determine whether it satisfies the requirements specified in sections 5.6.2 through 5.6.5 and the Appendix to this Code. IMDA will promptly seek public comments regarding the proposed RAO. Within 30 days from the date of the close of consultation on the proposed RAO, IMDA will notify the Mandated Licensee of its approval or rejection of the proposed RAO, or that IMDA requires additional time for its review. (b) If IMDA rejects any portion of the proposed RAO, it will provide the Mandated Licensee with a written explanation of the basis for the rejection and the modifications required to bring the proposed",en,254
473,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,". Unless IMDA specifies otherwise, IMDA will require the Mandated Licensee to offer a Mandated Service at a price that reflects the Mandated Licensee’s standard retail price for the most analogous retail service minus any avoidable costs resulting from offering the service in the manner specified by IMDA. 5.6.5 Modification and Duration of Reference Access Offer Agreement The RAO must provide that: (a) unless IMDA authorises the Mandated Licensee to withdraw its",en,64
474,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," determines, and after providing an opportunity for public comments, that the Licensee has control over any facility: (i) that is required as an input for the provision of a Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service; and (ii) that replicating the facility, or obtaining the use of such facility through other means, is infeasible or sufficiently costly or difficult that requiring other Licensees to do so would create a significant barrier to entry into such Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service market by an efficient competitor. (b) Where IMDA classifies a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee, IMDA will issue a notice in the Gazette which Licensee has been classified as a Mandated Licensee and the list of Mandated Services to be provided by this Mandated Licensee. 5.3 Standards and Procedures for Removing the Classification of a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee (a) In any case in which IMDA has classified a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee pursuant to section 5.2, IMDA will remove the classification of a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee, if IMDA determines, based on the factors specified in section 5.2, that the Licensee no longer satisfies the criteria for classification as a Mandated Licensee. (b) IMDA may remove the classification of a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee either: (i) on IMDA’s own initiative, when IMDA renews the Licensee’s licence or at any other time; or (ii) upon the request of the Mandated Licensee. (c) IMDA will seek public comments when reviewing whether to remove the classification of a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee. (d) Where IMDA determines that the classification of a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee should be removed, IMDA will issue a notice 25 in the Gazette revoking its earlier notice issued under section 5.2 (b). 5.4 Licensees Entitled to Enter into a Network Access Agreement Any Licensee may enter into a Network Access Agreement with a Mandated Licensee, pursuant to which the Licensee may obtain any Mandated Service for the provision of any domestic Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service to recipients in Singapore, including domestic delivery of inbound international Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail. 5.5 Options for Entering into a Network Access Agreement A Requesting Licensee may obtain any Mandated Service from a Mandated Licensee using either of the following 2 options: 5.5.1 Option 1: Network Access Pursuant to an Approved Reference Access Offer A Requesting Licensee may obtain any Mandated Service from a Mandated Licensee on the terms specified in a RAO developed by the Mandated Licensee and approved by IMDA. 5.5.2 Option 2: Network Access Pursuant to an Individualised Access Agreement A Requesting Licensee may obtain any Mandated Service by entering into an Individualised Access Agreement with a Mandated Licensee. Such agreements may be arrived at through voluntary negotiations or via the dispute resolution process specified in sections 5.7.2 through 5.7.2.3. 5.6 The Reference Access Offer The following provisions govern a Mandated Licensee’s RAO: 5.6.1 Duty to Develop and Modify a Reference Access Offer Within 30 days of being directed to do so by IMDA, a Mandated Licensee must submit a proposed RAO to IMDA for approval. 5.6.2 Services That Must be Offered under the Reference Access Offer (a) In its RAO, the Mandated Licensee must offer the Mandated Services specified in the Appendix to this Code. The RAO must incorporate any requirements (including any prices, terms and 26 conditions) that IMDA specifies in the Appendix to this Code. (b) IMDA will require the Mandated Licensee to offer access to inputs as a Mandated Service where IMDA concludes that: (i) the input is necessary for the provision of any Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service to recipients in Singapore, including the domestic delivery of inbound international Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail; and (ii) providing the input is infeasible or sufficiently costly or difficult such that requiring other Licensees to do so would create a significant barrier to the provision of any Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service to recipients in Singapore by an efficient competitor. (c) IMDA will require the Mandated Licensee, at the minimum, to: (i) provide Mandated Services to Requesting Licensees on prices, terms and conditions that are mandated, or approved, by IMDA; (ii) provide Mandated Services efficiently and without unreasonable delay; and (iii) deliver a Requesting Licensee’s Basic Letters and Direct Mail to any valid address within Singapore specified by the Sender. (d) IMDA may, at any appropriate time, review and revise the list of Mandated Services, and their applicable requirements (including prices, terms and conditions), in the Appendix to this Code. In each case, IMDA will seek public comments prior to adopting any modification. 5.6.3 Requirements of Reference Access Offer The RAO must comply with the following requirements: 5.6.3.1 Reference Access Offer Must be Clear, Complete and Modular (a) The RAO must: (i) contain a comprehensive and complete written statement of the prices, terms and conditions on which the Mandated 27 Licensee is prepared to provide Mandated Services to any Requesting Licensee (including a complete technical description of the Mandated Services offered, the procedures that will be used to order and provide such services, and the timeframes that will apply); (ii) be clearly written and organised in a logical and consistent manner; (iii) be modular, allowing a Requesting Licensee to purchase only those Mandated Services that it wants to obtain; and (iv) be sufficiently detailed to enable a Requesting Licensee that is willing to accept its prices, terms and conditions to obtain Mandated Services without having to engage in negotiations with the Mandated Licensee. (b) If a Requesting Licensee accepts the RAO, further discussions will be limited to implementing the accepted prices, terms and conditions. Such discussions should last no more than 30 days. 5.6.3.2 Additional Required Terms The RAO must contain the following: (a) a description of the quality of service that the Mandated Licensee will provide and the amount and manner in which the Requesting Licensee will be compensated for any failure by the Mandated Licensee to meet the quality of service standards; (b) a list and description of any reasonable restrictions or conditions that the Mandated Licensee intends to impose on the terms of the offer contained in the RAO – including any situation in which operational constraints will limit the ability of the Mandated Licensee to meet requests for Mandated Services, and any situation in which a Mandated Licensee will not offer (or will limit or condition an offer of) network access to a Requesting Licensee or class of Requesting Licensees; (c) a provision stating that the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee will refer disputes regarding network access arising from the implementation of the Network Access Agreement to IMDA for resolution and will seek IMDA’s written approval before unilaterally suspending or terminating the Network Access Agreement; and 28 (d) statements that: (i) if the RAO is accepted, the Network Access Agreement will constitute the entire agreement between the Mandated Licensee and the Requesting Licensee; (ii) if any provision of the Network Access Agreement is held to be unlawful or is required to be amended, all other provisions of the agreement will survive; (iii) the RAO will be governed by the laws of Singapore; and (iv) the Mandated Licensee will not unreasonably withhold consent from a Requesting Licensee seeking to assign its rights and obligations to another Licensee. 5.6.4 Pricing of Mandated Services Where a Mandated Licensee is required by IMDA to provide a Mandated Service pursuant to its RAO, the Mandated Licensee must offer the Mandated Service at a price that reflects the methodology specified by",en,1114
475,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may review these tariffs at any time to determine whether the prices, terms and conditions are just, reasonable and non- discriminatory and in accordance with the requirements of this Code. (b) Within 90 days of the date this Code comes into effect, all Dominant Licensees must publish on their websites all existing tariffs that are in effect. The information published must comply with the requirements of section 4.5. Where IMDA has directed the Dominant Licensee to review a tariff, the Dominant Licensee shall publish the tariff at such time as specified by IMDA upon completion of the tariff review. 23 5 PROVISION OF MANDATED SERVICES 5.1 Introduction and Definition of Individualised Access Agreement (a) In certain cases, a Licensee may control facilities that are required as an input for the provision of a Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service, and replicating the facilities, or obtaining the use of such facilities through other means, is infeasible or sufficiently costly or difficult that requiring other Licensees to do so would create a significant barrier to entry into a Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service market by an efficient competitor. In appropriate cases, IMDA may designate a Licensee that controls such facilities as a Mandated Licensee, and may require the Mandated Licensee to provide access to such inputs to other Licensees as a Mandated Service. The initial list of Mandated Services is set out in the Appendix to this Code. (b) A Requesting Licensee may only obtain a Mandated Service in order to provide any Basic Letter Service and/or Direct Mail Service (for Direct Mail of up to 500 grams in weight) to recipients in Singapore including the domestic delivery of inbound international Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail (of up to 500 grams in weight). Requesting Licensees may obtain such Mandated Service by entering into a Network Access Agreement with the Mandated Licensee. To facilitate this process, IMDA will require the Mandated Licensee to adopt a Reference Access Offer that specifies the prices, terms and conditions on which the Mandated Licensee will offer to provide the Mandated Service. IMDA will also establish procedures to resolve disputes where a Requesting Licensee seeks to negotiate an Individualised Access Agreement with the Mandated Licensee. (c) To the extent that section 5 and the Appendix to this Code create rights and obligations applicable to services used to provide domestic delivery of Direct Mail Services, these rights and obligations apply only to Direct Mail of up to 500 grams in weight. As such, any reference to Direct Mail Services or Direct Mail in section 5 and the Appendix to this Code is a reference to Direct Mail of up to 500 grams in weight. (d) In section 5, unless the context otherwise requires, “Individualised Access Agreement” means a Network Access Agreement negotiated on an individualised basis between a particular Requesting Licensee and a particular Mandated Licensee. 24 5.2 Standards and Procedures for Classifying a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee (a) IMDA will classify a Licensee as a Mandated Licensee where",en,452
477,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may review the effective tariff periodically to determine whether the prices, terms and conditions remain just, reasonable and non- discriminatory, and may direct the Dominant Licensee to make appropriate modifications. In addition, any person that believes that the prices, terms and conditions on which a Dominant Licensee is providing Basic Letter Services pursuant to an effective tariff are unjust, unreasonable or 22 discriminatory may petition IMDA to review those provisions. The petitioner must provide the basis for its belief. IMDA may also take enforcement action if it concludes that an effective tariff, or the Dominant Licensee’s implementation of an effective tariff, contravenes any provision of this Code. 4.8 Transitional Provisions 4.8.1 Existing Effective Tariffs (a) All existing effective tariffs filed by any Dominant Licensee before the date this Code comes into effect will remain in effect until such time as the Dominant Licensee modifies or withdraws the tariff, or",en,134
478,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may: (i) take enforcement action against the Dominant Licensee under section 9; (ii) direct the Dominant Licensee to amend its agreement to comply with the prices, terms and conditions in its effective tariff; and/or (iii) direct the Dominant Licensee to file a new tariff embodying the terms of the agreement. (c) In any case in which a Dominant Licensee enters into an agreement based on the terms of an effective tariff, and IMDA subsequently allows (or directs) the Dominant Licensee to modify the terms of such tariff, the Dominant Licensee must amend the agreement to be consistent with the modified tariff. 4.7 Review of Effective Tariffs Once IMDA allows a tariff to go into effect, IMDA will presume that the prices, terms and conditions are just, reasonable and non-discriminatory.",en,114
479,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,"’s approval to modify the tariff for an existing service, it must make the required publication no later than the date on which the modification becomes effective. The information must, at a minimum, include a service description, prices (including any discount structures), service availability and eligibility requirements. 4.6 Duty to Provide Services Consistent With Effective Tariffs (a) Dominant Licensees must provide Basic Letter Services on the prices, terms and conditions specified in the applicable effective tariffs. (b) In any case in which IMDA allows a proposed tariff to go into effect, and a Dominant Licensee subsequently enters into an agreement on terms that differ from those in its effective tariff,",en,98
480,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will also seek to determine whether the prices, terms and conditions are not discriminatory by comparing the prices, terms and conditions to those that the Dominant Licensee offers in other tariffs for comparable services. In cases in which IMDA determines that a Basic Letter Service has a widespread public impact, IMDA may also consider other relevant factors. (b) In the case of a tariff for a wholesale Basic Letter Service offered under section 4.3, IMDA will seek to determine whether the prices, terms and conditions are no less favourable than the prices, terms and conditions on which the Dominant Licensee offers any comparable service to its Customers. 4.4.2.3 Review Procedures In general, within 10 Working Days of receiving a proposed tariff, IMDA will either accept or reject the proposed tariff. If IMDA rejects the proposed tariff, it will provide a statement of the basis for its rejection. Where IMDA determines that it would be appropriate, it may take any of the following actions: (a) extend the review period; (b) seek additional information from the Dominant Licensee (including inspecting the accounts and other documents of the Dominant Licensee); (c) conduct an audit on the Dominant Licensee; (d) seek public comments; (e) allow the proposed tariff to go into effect on an interim basis, subject to retroactive adjustment if IMDA concludes that any price, term or condition in the tariff contravenes this Code; and/or (f) allow the proposed tariff to go into effect, subject to the Dominant Licensee’s acceptance of specific conditions that IMDA may impose. 4.5 Duty to Publish Tariffs The Dominant Licensee must disclose, by publishing on its website, the 21 effective tariff no later than the date on which it begins to provide the service described in the tariff. Where the Dominant Licensee has obtained",en,264
481,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will use the following process to review a proposed tariff: 4.4.2.1 Information to be Included Any proposed tariff must: (a) fully and clearly describe the Basic Letter Service to be offered; (b) contain a clear statement of the prices, terms and conditions (including any eligibility requirements) on which the Dominant Licensee offers to provide the Basic Letter Service; (c) list any discounts or special considerations that the Dominant Licensee will offer and the requirements that must be satisfied (such as minimum volume or term requirements) to obtain those discounts; (d) list the minimum period of time during which the Basic Letter Service will be available and the minimum period of time, if any, during which the Dominant Licensee will not increase the filed rates; (e) be self-contained and must include charges for any good or service not generally subject to tariff regulation when offered as part of a package; and (f) be accompanied by a memorandum that describes the proposed offering or modification and provides sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed offering or modification satisfies the relevant criteria specified in section 4.4.2.2. 4.4.2.2 Review Criteria In assessing whether a proposed tariff is just and reasonable, IMDA will apply the following criteria: (a) In the case of a tariff for a Basic Letter Service other than a wholesale Basic Letter Service, IMDA will assess whether the prices, terms and conditions are either excessive or inadequate. To assess whether the prices are excessive, IMDA will determine whether the prices are competitive with those in a “basket” of benchmark jurisdictions determined by IMDA. To determine 20 whether the prices are inadequate, IMDA will assess whether the prices are either above average incremental cost or not less than those offered by Licensees that provide a comparable service.",en,261
482,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,", differences in the prices, terms and conditions for comparable Basic Letter Services must be based on objective differences, such as, but not limited to, variations in the cost of the service provided, variations in the quantity or quality of service provided or variations in the duration of the service agreement 18 period. 4.2.3 Duty to Provide Services on an Unbundled Basis A Licensee that has been classified as a Dominant Licensee in a Basic Letter Services market must provide the Basic Letter Service in that market on an unbundled basis. Specifically, the Dominant Licensee must not require that, as a condition for purchasing such a Basic Letter Service, a Customer must also purchase any other Postal Service or non-postal service or equipment. However, the Dominant Licensee may offer Customers the option of purchasing a package that contains multiple Postal Services and non-postal services or equipment. 4.3 Wholesale Services Unless directed to do so by IMDA, a Licensee that has been classified as a Dominant Licensee in a Basic Letter Services market is not required to offer any Basic Letter Service to other Licensees on a wholesale basis. If Dominant Licensee chooses to offer a Basic Letter Service on a wholesale basis, however, the Dominant Licensee: (a) must offer the wholesale service at prices, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and non-discriminatory; (b) must not restrict the ability of another Licensee to the wholesale service as an input to provide another service; and (c) must not require such Licensee to disclose that it is using the Dominant Licensee’s wholesale service as an input into any service that the Licensee provides to its Customers. 4.4 Tariffing 4.4.1 Services for Which A Dominant Licensee Must File Tariffs A Licensee that has been classified as a Dominant Licensee in a Basic Letter Services market must: (a) file a tariff with IMDA and obtain IMDA’s written approval prior to offering, or modifying the terms on which it offers, any Basic Letter Service that it provides in that market, including services designed for specific Customers; and (b) obtain IMDA’s written approval prior to withdrawing the Basic Letter Service that it provides pursuant to an effective tariff. 19 4.4.2 Tariff Filing and Review",en,329
483,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," classifies it as a Dominant Licensee. Section 4 also establishes a tariff filing, review and publication regime designed to ensure compliance. 4.2 Duties Applicable to the Provision of Basic Letter Services The following duties are applicable to the provision of Basic Letter Services by a Dominant Licensee: 4.2.1 Duty to Provide Services at Just and Reasonable Prices, Terms and Conditions A Licensee that has been classified as a Dominant Licensee in a Basic Letter Services market must provide such service in that market to Customers at prices, terms and conditions that are just and reasonable. 4.2.2 Duty to Provide Services on a Non-discriminatory Basis (a) A Licensee that has been classified as a Dominant Licensee in a Basic Letter Services market: (i) must provide such Basic Letter Service in that market to Customers at prices, terms and conditions that are not discriminatory; and (ii) must not discriminate in favour of itself or any Affiliate in the provision of such Basic Letter Service in that market. (b) This duty to provide Basic Letter Services on a non-discriminatory basis requires that except where otherwise permitted or required by",en,167
484,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," TERMS 4.1 Introduction To the extent that Licensees are not subject to competitive market forces in any Basic Letter Services market, regulatory intervention is necessary to ensure that Licensees provide such service on just, reasonable and non- discriminatory prices, terms and conditions. Section 4 sets out the requirements with which a Licensee must comply in any market in which",en,53
486,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," consists of all information relating to a Sender or Recipient that a Licensee obtains as a result of a Sender’s use of a Basic Letter Service and/or a Direct Mail Service provided by the Licensee and/or a Recipient’s receipt of Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail delivered by the Licensee. This includes, but is not limited to, information regarding: 16 (a) the Sender’s usage patterns (including, without limitation, frequency of use, the profile of Recipients of its Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail, etc.); (b) the Sender’s name and address; (c) the source and frequency of Basic Letters and/or Direct Mail delivered to the Recipient; and (d) the Recipient’s name and address. 3.4.2 Prohibition on Unauthorised Use (a) A Licensee must adopt appropriate procedures to ensure that, unless the Sender or Recipient (as the case may be) has provided prior consent, the Licensee will not use EUSI for any purpose other than providing assistance to law enforcement, judicial or other government agencies. (b) The Licensee must further ensure that, unless the Sender or Recipient (as the case may be) has provided consent, the Licensee will not provide EUSI to any third party (including its Affiliates). 17 4 DUTY OF DOMINANT LICENSEES TO PROVIDE BASIC",en,181
487,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will determine whether a Licensee has the ability to exercise Significant Market Power in a market as follows: (a) IMDA will first determine the relevant product or service, geographic and functional market or markets in which the Licensee participates. (b) For each relevant market, IMDA will conduct a competitiveness assessment by: (i) determining the market participants and their market shares; (ii) considering other factors that would increase or decrease the ability of the Licensee to act anti-competitively; and (iii) considering evidence of actual market performance. 2.6 Exemption from Dominant Licensee Provisions (a) A Dominant Licensee that seeks exemption from any provision of this Code specifically applicable to Dominant Licensees must submit an application to IMDA that identifies: (i) the specific provisions of this Code (with section numbers) from which the Dominant Licensee seeks exemption; and (ii) the specific Basic Letter Services market or markets in which the Dominant Licensee seeks exemption. 14 (b) The Dominant Licensee must demonstrate that the continued application of the provision to the Basic Letter Service is not necessary to protect Customers that use the service to send their own Letters or to promote and preserve effective competition among Licensees. (c) IMDA will notify the Dominant Licensee of the date on which it accepts the request. (d) IMDA will provide an opportunity for public comments before issuing a preliminary decision and a final decision granting or denying the request.

(e) IMDA may grant the request in full or in part, and subject to any appropriate condition that IMDA may impose. (f) Where IMDA grants a Dominant Licensee an exemption under section 2.6, IMDA will issue a notice in the Gazette specifying the Basic Letter Services market or markets and provisions of the Code to which the exemption applies. 15 3 DUTY OF LICENSEES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 3.1 Introduction All Licensees must comply with the following obligations when providing any Basic Letter Service, and in addition, comply with the obligations set out in section 3.4 when providing any Direct Mail Service. 3.2 Duty to Comply With IMDA’s Quality of Service Standards Licensees must comply with any minimum quality of service standards applicable to Basic Letter Services issued by IMDA. However, a Licensee and a Customer may agree to a lower quality of service standard. In such cases, the Licensee must clearly inform the Customer of the service level that it will provide and the fact that it is different from IMDA’s minimum quality of service standards. 3.3 Duty to Disclose Prices, Terms and Conditions Prior to providing any Basic Letter Service to a Customer, a Licensee must disclose to that Customer the prices, terms and conditions (including quality of service) on which the Licensee provides the service. The Licensee may fulfil this duty by publishing, in a form available to the public, the prices, terms and conditions of that Basic Letter Service no later than the day on which the Licensee begins to provide the service. The information must be in a manner that is readily available, current and easy- to-understand. 3.4 Duty to Prevent Unauthorised Use of End User Service Information Licensees must take reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorised use of End User Service Information (“EUSI”).

488,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," has previously classified it as a Dominant Licensee. (b) At any other time, IMDA may classify a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee in a specific Basic Letter Services market if IMDA determines, based on the factors specified in section 2.5, and after providing an opportunity for public comments, that the Licensee has Significant Market Power in that market. In such cases, the Dominant Licensee will be subject to the special obligations applicable to Dominant Licensees only in that Basic Letter Services market in which IMDA has determined that the Licensee has Significant Market Power. (c) Where IMDA classifies a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee, IMDA will issue a notice in the Gazette. In doing so, IMDA will indicate the basis or bases on which it has declared the Licensee to be dominant and, where applicable, the specific market or markets in which IMDA has found the Licensee to be dominant. 2.3 Standards and Procedures for Removing a Dominant Licensee Classification (a) In any case in which IMDA has classified a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee in one or more Basic Letter Services markets pursuant to section 2.2, IMDA will remove the classification of a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee in a specific market if IMDA determines, based on the factors specified in section 2.5, that the Licensee no longer has Significant Market Power in that market. (b) IMDA may remove the classification of a Licensee as a Dominant 12 Licensee in a specific market under paragraph (a) either: (i) on its own initiative, when IMDA renews the Dominant Licensee’s licence or at any other time; or (ii) upon the request of the Dominant Licensee. (c) IMDA will not accept a request for reclassification until the Dominant Licensee has provided verifiable data to support its request.

IMDA will notify the Dominant Licensee of the date on which it accepts the request. (d) IMDA will provide an opportunity for public comments before issuing a preliminary decision and a final decision granting or denying the request. In each case, IMDA will seek to issue its preliminary and final decision within 90 days from the close of public consultation. Where appropriate, IMDA may extend the time by which IMDA will issue its preliminary and final decision by providing a written notice to the Dominant Licensee before the end of each 90-day period.

(b) Where a Dominant Licensee wishes to transfer to another entity ownership or operational control of its facilities and/or its business as a going concern, the Dominant Licensee must obtain IMDA’s approval prior to effecting the transfer. IMDA may approve the transfer request in full or in part, and subject the approval to any 13 appropriate condition that IMDA may impose (including classifying the transferee as a Dominant Licensee in all the markets in which the transferor was classified as a Dominant Licensee prior to the transfer). (c) Where a Dominant Licensee transfers to another entity ownership or operational control of its facilities and/or its business as a going concern, without first obtaining IMDA’s approval, in addition to the enforcement measures that IMDA may take against the Dominant Licensee for contravention of this Code, the transferee will be required to comply with the provisions applicable to Dominant Licensees under this Code in relation to the transferred facilities and/or business. 2.5 Determining a Licensee’s Ability to Exercise Significant Market Power",en,620
489,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will impose minimum regulatory “rules of the road” coupled with the ex post enforcement of general prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct. In contrast, where IMDA concludes that a Licensee has Significant Market Power in any Basic Letter Services market and, therefore, that the Licensee’s conduct is not adequately constrained by competitive market forces, IMDA will classify the Licensee as a Dominant Licensee in that market, and will require the Licensee to comply with more 11 stringent regulatory requirements in that market. Section 2.2 sets out the standards and procedures that IMDA will apply in determining whether a Licensee should be classified as a Dominant Licensee in any Basic Letter Services market. 2.2 Standards and Procedures for Classifying a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee (a) Upon issuance of this Code, IMDA may classify a Licensee as a Dominant Licensee in all Basic Letter Services markets if prior to 1 April 2007, the Licensee enjoyed the right to provide any Basic Letter Service on an exclusive basis. In such cases, the Dominant Licensee will be subject to the special obligations applicable to Dominant Licensees in all Basic Letter Services markets until such time, if ever, as IMDA reclassifies the Licensee as non-dominant, pursuant to section 2.3, in any Basic Letter Services market in which",en,191

In case of any ambiguity, IMDA will interpret this Code in the manner most consistent with the regulatory principles specified in section 1.4. 1.8 Definitions This section defines specialised terms that are used in more than one 7 section of this Code. Specialised terms that are used in only one section of this Code are defined within that section. In this Code, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) “Acquiring Party” means – (i) any person, whether alone or together with its Associates, that is required to obtain IMDA’s approval under sections 26B(2), (3) or (4) of the Act; or (ii) for the purposes of section 8.3, any person, whether alone or together with its Associates, that first acquires 5% or more Voting Shares or control of voting power in a Designated Postal Licensee but is not a 12% Controller or a 30% Controller of the Designated Postal Licensee; (b) “Act” means the Postal Services Act (Cap. 237A); (c) “Affiliate” means, in relation to a person (X), X, is an affiliate of another person, Y, if – (i) X is an entity which has an attributable interest (direct or indirect) in Y of 5% or more (referred to in this paragraph as a parent); (ii) Y is an entity in which X has an attributable interest (direct or indirect) of 5% or more (referred to in this paragraph as a subsidiary); or (iii) X is an entity in which Y’s parent has an attributable interest (direct or indirect) of 5% or more (referred to in this paragraph as a sibling), but X will not be considered an affiliate of Y if the common parent of X and Y has only a passive ownership interest in the 2 sibling entities, such as where the parent entity does not in practice cause the subsidiary entity to take, or prevent the subsidiary entity from taking, decisions regarding the management and major operating decisions of the entity, and any person’s attributable interest shall be determined using the",en,314
493,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," may modify or eliminate provisions that it determines, based on experience, and the growth and development of competition, are no longer necessary. IMDA may also make any other changes necessary to achieve 6 the goals of this Code. 1.5.2 Petitions for Modification or Elimination of Provisions of this Code Licensees may petition IMDA to modify or eliminate any provision of this Code. The Licensee must specify the provisions of this Code that it seeks to have modified or eliminated, and must provide a clear statement of the reasons why the Licensee believes that such actions are justified. The Licensee may propose alternative approaches that, if adopted, would achieve IMDA’s regulatory objectives in a less burdensome or more effective manner. 1.6 Exemptions, Waivers and Suspensions (a) Where good cause is shown, IMDA may grant exemptions from specific provisions of this Code. Such exemptions may be applied to individual Licensees or to specified categories of Licensees. An exemption may be permanent, temporary (either for a fixed period or effective until the occurrence of a specific event) or on a one- time basis. Where appropriate, IMDA may grant exemptions subject to compliance with specified conditions and may seek public comments before doing so. (b) IMDA may waive or suspend any provision of this Code that imposes an obligation on IMDA in any situation in which such action is necessary in the public interest. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, as section 8 of this Code describes certain obligations of Acquiring Parties and Designated Postal Licensees under the Regulations, IMDA may only reduce or extend the time required by the Regulations, or waive any other requirement in regulation 6 (3), 7 (5) or (6), 8 (3) or 9 (1) (a) or (b) of the Regulations, for the giving of any notice or making of any application, in accordance with regulation 11 of the Regulations. 1.7 Rules of Construction",en,283
495,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will modify and, where appropriate, eliminate the provisions of this Code to reflect changing market conditions. There are 2 ways in which the Code may be modified. In each case, IMDA will seek public comments prior to adopting any modification. 1.5.1 Regulatory Review",en,39
496,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,", where feasible and appropriate, will consult with other regulatory authorities in Singapore in order to facilitate the development of a consistent regulatory policy that promotes fair and effective competition and serves the public interest. 1.5 Modification and Elimination of Provisions",en,36
497,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017,"’s decisions will be non-discriminatory. IMDA will treat similarly situated Licensees on an equivalent basis. Where appropriate, IMDA’s decisions will reflect relevant differences between Licensees or categories of Licensees. 1.4.8 Consultation with Other Regulatory Authorities",en,30
498,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will strive to make all decisions pursuant to this Code within the timeframes specified herein and, in any case, as quickly as reasonably possible. 1.4.7 Non-discrimination",en,23
499,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will provide an opportunity for public comments in connection with material issues. Except to the extent that information submitted to IMDA 5 is confidential, proprietary, commercially sensitive or raises law enforcement or national security concerns, comments will be made available to the public. In arriving at its decisions, IMDA will give full consideration to the comments received. IMDA will generally make available to the public its decisions adopted pursuant to this Code, and will clearly explain the basis for its actions. IMDA will generally also make public any enforcement action taken pursuant to this Code. Where feasible and appropriate, IMDA will make available its decisions on its website ( ). IMDA will also issue guidelines, where appropriate, clarifying the standards and procedures that it will use to implement this Code. 1.4.6 Avoidance of Unnecessary Delay",en,121
501,SG_Postal Competition Code 2017," will seek to preserve public confidence in the postal system by ensuring that Licensees take effective measures to keep mail safe and secure. 1.4.2 Reliance on Market Forces Market forces are generally far more effective than regulation in 4 promoting consumer welfare. Competitive markets are most likely to provide consumers with a wide choice of services at just and reasonable prices. Therefore, to the extent that any Basic Letter Services market is competitive, IMDA will place primary reliance on private negotiations and industry self-regulation, subject to minimum requirements designed to protect consumers and prevent anti-competitive conduct. 1.4.3 Promotion of Effective and Sustainable Competition Recognising the effectiveness of market forces in promoting consumer welfare, IMDA will take appropriate measures to promote and maintain effective and sustainable competition to the extent possible. Such measures will include: (a) removing or minimising any unnecessary regulatory impediment to entry into and exit from any Basic Letter Services market; (b) curtailing any concentration of Significant Market Power that has, or may have, the effect of unreasonably restricting competition in any Basic Letter Services market; (c) deterring and remedying any anti-competitive behaviour by industry participants in any Basic Letter Services market; (d) ensuring that industry participants and consumers have easy access to information regarding market conditions in any Basic Letter Services market; and (e) ensuring that Licensees have reasonable access to postal network services, where necessary, to allow competitive provision of any Basic Letter Service. 1.4.4 Proportionate Regulation To the extent that a Basic Letter Services market is not yet competitive, ex ante regulatory intervention is likely to remain necessary. Where this is the case, IMDA will seek to impose regulatory requirements that are carefully crafted to achieve clearly articulated results. Such requirements will be no broader than necessary to achieve IMDA’s stated goals. 1.4.5 Transparent and Reasoned Decision Making",en,268

However, we annul Section 35 of the law as violative of Article 3, Sec. 1, of the Constitution providing that no person shall ""be deprived of the equal protection of laws."" We arrive at these conclusions with a full awareness of the criticism it is certain to provoke. While ruling against the discrimination in this case, we may ourselves be accused of similar discrimination through the exercise of our ultimate power in our own favor. This is inevitable. Criticism of judicial conduct, however undeserved, is a fact of life in the political system that we are prepared to accept.. As judges, we cannot debate with our detractors. We can only decide the cases before us as law imposes on us the duty to be fair and our own conscience gives us the light to be right.",en,160
1124,PH_GR 105371 Franking Privilege 1993," The third and most serious challenge of the petitioners is based on the equal protection clause. It is alleged that R.A. No. 7354 is discriminatory because while withdrawing the franking privilege from the Judiciary, it retains the same for the President of the Philippines, the Vice President of the Philippines; Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, the Commission on Elections; former Presidents of the Philippines; the National Census and Statistics Office; and the general public in the filing of complaints against public offices and officers.10 The respondents counter that there is no discrimination because the law is based on a valid classification in accordance with the equal protection clause. In fact, the franking privilege has been withdrawn not only from the Judiciary but also the Office of Adult Education, the Institute of National Language; the Telecommunications Office; the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation; the National Historical Commission; the Armed Forces of the Philippines; the Armed Forces of the Philippines Ladies Steering Committee; the City and Provincial Prosecutors; the Tanodbayan (Office of Special Prosecutor); the Kabataang Barangay; the Commission on the Filipino Language; the Provincial and City Assessors; and the National Council for the Welfare of Disabled Persons.11 The equal protection of the laws is embraced in the concept of due process, as every unfair discrimination offends the requirements of justice and fair play. It has nonetheless been embodied in a separate clause in Article III Sec. 1., of the Constitution to provide for a more, specific guaranty against any form of undue favoritism or hostility from the government. Arbitrariness in general may be challenged on the basis of the due process clause. But if the particular act assailed partakes of an unwarranted partiality or prejudice, the sharper weapon to cut it down is the equal protection clause. According to a long line of decisions, equal protection simply requires that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed, 12 Similar subjects, in other words, should not be treated differently, so as to give undue favor to some and unjustly discriminate against others. The equal protection clause does not require the universal application of the laws on all persons or things without distinction. This might in fact sometimes result in unequal protection, as where, for example, a law prohibiting mature books to all persons, regardless of age, would benefit the morals of the youth but violate the liberty of adults. What the clause requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification. By classification is meant the grouping of persons or things similar to each other in certain particulars and different from all others in these same particulars. 13 What is the reason for the grant of the franking privilege in the first place? Is the franking privilege extended to the President of the Philippines or the Commission on Elections or to former Presidents of the Philippines purely as a courtesy from the lawmaking body? Is it offered because of the importance or status of the grantee or because of its need for the privilege? Or have the grantees been chosen pell-mell, as it were, without any basis at all for the selection? We reject outright the last conjecture as there is no doubt that the statute as a whole was carefully deliberated upon, by the political departments before it was finally enacted. There is reason to suspect, however, that not enough care or attention was given to its repealing clause, resulting in the unwitting withdrawal of the franking privilege from the Judiciary. We also do not believe that the basis of the classification was mere courtesy, for it is unimaginable that the political departments would have intended this serious slight to the Judiciary as the third of the major and equal departments the government. The same observations are made if the importance or status of the grantee was the criterion used for the extension of the franking privilege, which is enjoyed by the National Census and Statistics Office and even some private individuals but not the courts of justice. In our view, the only acceptable reason for the grant of the franking privilege was the perceived need of the grantee for the accommodation, which would justify a waiver of substantial revenue by the Corporation in the interest of providing for a smoother flow of communication between the government and the people. Assuming that basis, we cannot understand why, of all the departments of the government, it is the Judiciary, that has been denied the franking privilege. There is no question that if there is any major branch of the government that needs the privilege, it is the Judicial Department, as the respondents themselves point out. Curiously, the respondents would justify the distinction on the basis precisely of this need and, on this basis, deny the Judiciary the franking privilege while extending it to others less deserving. In their Comment, the respondents point out that available data from the Postal Service Office show that from January 1988 to June 1992, the total volume of frank mails amounted to P90,424,175.00. Of this amount, frank mails from the Judiciary and other agencies whose functions include the service of judicial processes, such as the intervenor, the Department of Justice and the Office of the Ombudsman, amounted to P86,481,759. Frank mails coming fromthe Judiciary amounted to P73,574,864.00, and those coming from the petitioners reached the total amount of P60,991,431.00. The respondents' conclusion is that because of this considerable volume of mail from the Judiciary, the franking privilege must be withdrawn from it. The argument is self-defeating. The respondents are in effect saying that the franking privilege should be extended only to those who do not need it very much, if at all, (like the widows of former Presidents) but not to those who need it badly (especially the courts of justice). It is like saying that a person may be allowed cosmetic surgery although it is not really necessary but not an operation that can save his life. If the problem of the respondents is the loss of revenues from the franking privilege, the remedy, it seems to us, is to withdraw it altogether from all agencies of government, including those who do not need it. The problem is not solved by retaining it for some and withdrawing it from others, especially where there is no substantial distinction between those favored, which may or may not need it at all, and the Judiciary, which definitely needs it. The problem is not solved by violating the Constitution. In lumping the Judiciary with the other offices from which the franking privilege has been withdrawn, Section 35 has placed the courts of justice in a category to which it does not belong. If it recognizes the need of the President of the Philippines and the members of Congress for the franking privilege, there is no reason why it should not recognize a similar and in fact greater need on the part of the Judiciary for such privilege. While we may appreciate the withdrawal of the franking privilege from the Armed Forces of the Philippines Ladies Steering Committee, we fail to understand why the Supreme Court should be similarly treated as that Committee. And while we may concede the need of the National Census and Statistics Office for the franking privilege, we are intrigued that a similar if not greater need is not recognized in the courts of justice. (On second thought, there does not seem to be any justifiable need for withdrawing the privilege from the Armed Forces of the Philippines Ladies Steering Committee, which, like former Presidents of the Philippines or their widows, does not send as much frank mail as the Judiciary.) It is worth observing that the Philippine Postal Corporation, as a government-controlled corporation, was created and is expected to operate for the purpose of promoting the public service. While it may have been established primarily for private gain, it cannot excuse itself from performing certain functions for the benefit file:///Users/janinedevera/Downloads/PH_GR%20105371%20Franking%20Privilege%201993.html Page 3 of 4 G.R. No. 105371 2/16/23, 9:35 AM of the public in exchange for the franchise extended to it by the government and the many advantages it enjoys under its charter.14 Among the services it should be prepared to extend is free carriage of mail for certain offices of the government that need the franking privilege in the discharge of their own public functions. We also note that under Section 9 of the law, the Corporation is capitalized at P10 billion pesos, 55% of which is supplied by the Government, and that it derives substantial revenues from the sources enumerated in Section 10, on top of the exemptions it enjoys. It is not likely that the retention of the franking privilege of the Judiciary will cripple the Corporation. At this time when the Judiciary is being faulted for the delay in the administration of justice, the withdrawal from it of the franking privilege can only further deepen this serious problem. The volume of judicial mail, as emphasized by the respondents themselves, should stress the dependence of the courts of justice on the postal service for communicating with lawyers and litigants as part of the judicial process. The Judiciary has the lowest appropriation in the national budget compared to the Legislative and Executive Departments; of the P309 billion budgeted for 1993, only .84%, or less than 1%, is alloted for the judiciary. It should not be hard to imagine the increased difficulties of our courts if they have to affix a purchased stamp to every process they send in the discharge of their judicial functions. We are unable to agree with the respondents that Section 35 of R.A. No. 7354 represents a valid exercise of discretion by the Legislature under the police power. On the contrary, we find its repealing clause to be a discriminatory provision that denies the Judiciary the equal protection of the laws guaranteed for all persons or things similarly situated. The distinction made by the law is superficial. It is not based on substantial distinctions that make real differences between the Judiciary and the grantees of the franking privilege. This is not a question of wisdom or power into which the Judiciary may not intrude. It is a matter of arbitrariness that this Court has the duty and power to correct.",en,1650
1125,PH_GR 105371 Franking Privilege 1993," The petitioners maintain that the second paragraph of Sec. 35 covering the repeal of the franking privilege from the petitioners and this Court under E.O. 207, PD 1882 and PD 26 was not included in the original version of Senate Bill No. 720 or House Bill No. 4200. As this paragraph appeared only in the Conference Committee Report, its addition, violates Article VI, Sec. 26(2) of the Constitution, reading as follows: (2)No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency. Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal. The petitioners also invoke Sec. 74 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, requiring that amendment to any bill when the House and the Senate shall have differences thereon may be settled by a conference committee of both chambers. They stress that Sec. 35 was never a subject of any disagreement between both Houses and so the second paragraph could not have been validly added as an amendment. These argument are unacceptable. While it is true that a conference committee is the mechanism for compromising differences between the Senate and the House, it is not limited in its jurisdiction to this question. Its broader function is described thus: A conference committee may, deal generally with the subject matter or it may be limited to resolving the precise differences between the two houses. Even where the conference committee is not by rule limited in its jurisdiction, legislative custom severely limits the freedom with which new subject matter can be inserted into the conference bill. But occasionally a conference committee produces unexpected results, results beyond its mandate, These excursions occur even where the rules impose strict limitations on conference committee jurisdiction. This is symptomatic of the authoritarian power of conference committee (Davies, Legislative Law and Process: In a Nutshell, 1986 Ed., p.81). It is a matter of record that the conference Committee Report on the bill in question was returned to and duly approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Thereafter, the bill was enrolled with its certification by Senate President Neptali A. Gonzales and Speaker Ramon V. Mitra of the House of Representatives as having been duly passed by both Houses of Congress. It was then presented to and approved by President Corazon C. Aquino on April 3, 1992. Under the doctrine of separation powers, the Court may not inquire beyond the certification of the approval of a bill from the presiding officers of Congress. Casco Philippine Chemical Co. v. Gimenez7 laid down the rule that the enrolled bill, is conclusive upon the Judiciary (except in matters that have to be entered in the journals like the yeas and nays on the final reading of the file:///Users/janinedevera/Downloads/PH_GR%20105371%20Franking%20Privilege%201993.html Page 2 of 4 G.R. No. 105371 2/16/23, 9:35 AM bill).8 The journals are themselves also binding on the Supreme Court, as we held in the old (but still valid) case of U.S. vs. Pons,9 where we explained the reason thus: To inquire into the veracity of the journals of the Philippine legislature when they are, as we have said, clear and explicit, would be to violate both the, letter and spirit of the organic laws by which the Philippine Government was brought into existence, to invade a coordinate and independent department of the Government, and to interfere with the legitimate powers and functions, of the Legislature. Applying these principles, we shall decline to look into the petitioners' charges that an amendment was made upon the last reading of the bill that eventually became R.A. No. 7354 and that copies thereof in its final form were not distributed among the members of each House. Both the enrolled bill and the legislative journals certify that the measure was duly enacted i.e., in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 26(2) of the Constitution. We are bound by such official assurances from a coordinate department of the government, to which we owe, at the very least, a becoming courtesy.",en,689
1126,PH_GR 105371 Franking Privilege 1993,", J.: The basic issue raised in this petition is the independence of the Judiciary. It is asserted by the petitioners that this hallmark of republicanism is impaired by the statute and circular they are here challenging. The Supreme Court is itself affected by these measures and is thus an interested party that should ordinarily not also be a judge at the same time. Under our system of government, however, it cannot inhibit itself and must rule upon the challenge, because no other office has the authority to do so. We shall therefore act upon this matter not with officiousness but in the discharge of an unavoidable duty and, as always, with detachment and fairness. The main target of this petition is Section 35 of R.A. No. 7354 as implemented by the Philippine Postal Corporation through its Circular No. 92-28. These measures withdraw the franking privilege from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Regional Trial Courts, the Metropolitan Trial Courts, the Municipal Trial Courts, and the Land Registration Commission and its Registers of Deeds, along with certain other government offices. The petitioners are members of the lower courts who feel that their official functions as judges will be prejudiced by the above-named measures. The National Land Registration Authority has taken common cause with them insofar as its own activities, such as sending of requisite notices in registration cases, affect judicial proceedings. On its motion, it has been allowed to intervene. The petition assails the constitutionality of R.A. No. 7354 on the grounds that: (1) its title embraces more than one subject and does not express its purposes; (2) it did not pass the required readings in both Houses of Congress and printed copies of the bill in its final form were not distributed among the members before its passage; and (3) it is discriminatory and encroaches on the independence of the Judiciary. We approach these issues with one important principle in mind, to wit, the presumption of the constitutionality of statutes. The theory is that as the joint act of the Legislature and the Executive, every statute is supposed to have first been carefully studied and determined to be constitutional before it was finally enacted. Hence, unless it is clearly shown that it is constitutionally flawed, the attack against its validity must be rejected and the law itself upheld. To doubt is to sustain. I We consider first the objection based on Article VI, Sec. 26(l), of the Constitution providing that ""Every bill passed by the Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in the title thereof."" The purposes of this rule are: (1) to prevent hodge-podge or ""log-rolling"" legislation; (2) to prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature by means of provisions in bills of which the title gives no intimation, and which might therefore be overlooked and carelessly and unintentionally adopted; and (3) to fairly apprise the people, through such publication of legislative proceedings as is usually made, of the subject of legislation that is being considered, in order that they may have opportunity of being heard thereon, by petition or otherwise, if they shall so desire.1 It is the submission of the petitioners that Section 35 of R.A. No. 7354 which withdrew the franking privilege from the Judiciary is not expressed in the title of the law, nor does it reflect its purposes. R.A. No. 7354 is entitled ""An Act Creating the Philippine Postal Corporation, Defining its Powers, Functions and Responsibilities, Providing for Regulation of the Industry and for Other Purposes Connected Therewith."" file:///Users/janinedevera/Downloads/PH_GR%20105371%20Franking%20Privilege%201993.html Page 1 of 4 G.R. No. 105371 2/16/23, 9:35 AM The objectives of the law are enumerated in Section 3, which provides: The State shall pursue the following objectives of a nationwide postal system: a)to enable the economical and speedy transfer of mail and other postal matters, from sender to addressee, with full recognition of their privacy or confidentiality; b)to promote international interchange, cooperation and understanding through the unhampered flow or exchange of postal matters between nations; c)to cause or effect a wide range of postal services to cater to different users and changing needs, including but not limited to, philately, transfer of monies and valuables, and the like; d)to ensure that sufficient revenues are generated by and within the industry to finance the overall cost of providing the varied range of postal delivery and messengerial services as well as the expansion and continuous upgrading of service standards by the same. Sec. 35 of R.A. No. 7354, which is the principal target of the petition, reads as follows: Sec. 35.Repealing Clause. — All acts, decrees, orders, executive orders, instructions, rules and regulations or parts thereof inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are repealed or modified accordingly. All franking privileges authorized by law are hereby repealed, except those provided for under Commonwealth Act No. 265, Republic Acts Numbered 69, 180, 1414, 2087 and 5059. The Corporation may continue the franking privilege under Circular No. 35 dated October 24, 1977 and that of the Vice President, under such arrangements and conditions as may obviate abuse or unauthorized use thereof. The petitioners' contention is untenable. We do not agree that the title of the challenged act violates the Constitution. The title of the bill is not required to be an index to the body of the act, or to be as comprehensive as to cover every single detail of the measure. It has been held that if the title fairly indicates the general subject, and reasonably covers all the provisions of the act, and is not calculated to mislead the legislature or the people, there is sufficient compliance with the constitutional requirement. 2 To require every end and means necessary for the accomplishment of the general objectives of the statute to be expressed in its title would not only be unreasonable but would actually render legislation impossible. 3 As has been correctly explained: The details of a legislative act need not be specifically stated in its title, but matter germane to the subject as expressed in the title, and adopted to the accomplishment of the object in view, may properly be included in the act. Thus, it is proper to create in the same act the machinery by which the act is to be enforced, to prescribe the penalties for its infraction, and to remove obstacles in the way of its execution. If such matters are properly connected with the subject as expressed in the title, it is unnecessary that they should also have special mention in the title (Southern Pac. Co. v. Bartine, 170 Fed. 725). This is particularly true of the repealing clause, on which Cooley writes: ""The repeal of a statute on a given subject is properly connected with the subject matter of a new statute on the same subject; and therefore a repealing section in the new statute is valid, notwithstanding that the title is silent on the subject. It would be difficult to conceive of a matter more germane to an act and to the object to be accomplished thereby than the repeal of previous legislations connected therewith.""4 The reason is that where a statute repeals a former law, such repeal is the effect and not the subject of the statute; and it is the subject, not the effect of a law, which is required to be briefly expressed in its title.5 As observed in one case,6 if the title of an act embraces only one subject, we apprehend it was never claimed that every other act which repeals it or alters by implication must be mentioned in the title of the new act. Any such rule would be neither within the reason of the Constitution, nor practicable. We are convinced that the withdrawal of the franking privilege from some agencies is germane to the accomplishment of the principal objective of R.A. No. 7354, which is the creation of a more efficient and effective postal service system. Our ruling is that, by virtue of its nature as a repealing clause, Section 35 did not have to be expressly included in the title of the said law.",en,1283

Procurement covering lease of real property and venue for official use, where: i. Real Property refers to land and buildings (office spaces or units) and constructions of all kinds adhered to the soil. ii. Venue refers to training centers, convention halls, hotels, and similar establishments catering to trainings, seminars, conferences, conventions, symposia and similar gatherings requiring the official participation of government officials and employees. This may include meals and accommodation depending on the requirements of the Procuring Entity. iii. Lessee refers to any government agency temporarily occupying a real property on the basis of a contract executed with the private individual, partnership, cooperative, association, or corporation having absolute ownership over such real property. iv. Lessor refers to any government agency or private individual, partnership, cooperative, association, or corporation having absolute ownership over the real property or venue to be leased. b) Policy Considerations i. Publicly-owned vis-a-vis privately-owned real property and venue It is preferred that government agencies lease publicly-owned real property or venue from other government agencies. 28 Section 53.10, IRR of R.A. 9184. Page 132 of 149 If there is an available publicly-owned real property or venue that complies with the requirements of the Procuring Entity, it may enter into a contract of lease with the government-agency owner. In the event that the Procuring Entity would resort to privately-owned real property or venue, the End-User unit shall justify that the same is more efficient and economical to the government. ii. Location The location of the real property or venue to be leased should have been meticulously selected by the Procuring Entity after taking into consideration, among others, the need for prudence and economy in government service and the suitability of the area in relation to the mandate of the office, and its accessibility to its clients. In the lease of venue, other factors such as the nature of the event or the level of security in the proposed location may also be taken into account. iii. ABC and rental rates The ABC shall be set using the mid point of the range obtained from the results of the market analysis on the prevailing lease rates for real property or venue within the vicinity of the selected location complying with the criteria and technical specifications of the End-User Unit. In no case shall the rental rates, including additional expenses, such as association dues in the case of lease of real property, exceed the ABC. As a general rule, rental rates are considered reasonable when they represent or approximate the value of what the Lessee gets in terms of accommodation, facility, amenities, and convenience from the leased real property or venue, and the Lessor gets an equitable return of capital or investment. Rental rates should also be within the prevailing market rates for lease of real property or venue with the same or similar condition or classification and located within the vicinity. Rental rate refers to the amount paid by the Lessee for the use and/or occupancy of the privately-owned real property to the Lessor, where payment is usually made on a monthly basis. iv. Technical Specifications Technical Specification shall be prepared taking into consideration the rating factors under Appendix B of this Guidelines. c) Procedures for Lease of Privately-Owned Real Property and Venue i.

Direct Contracting or single source procurement is a method of procurement of goods that does not require elaborate Bidding Documents. The supplier is simply asked to submit a price quotation or a pro-forma invoice together with the conditions of sale. The offer may be accepted immediately or after some negotiations. Direct Contracting may be resorted to under any of the following conditions: a) Procurement of goods of proprietary nature which can be obtained only from the proprietary source, i.e., when patents, trade secrets, and copyrights prohibit others from manufacturing the same item; b) When the procurement of critical components from a specific supplier is a condition precedent to hold a contractor to guarantee its project performance, in accordance with the provisions of its contract; or c) Those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer which does not have sub- dealers selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can be obtained at more advantageous terms to the government. To justify the need to procure through the Direct Contracting method, the End-User should conduct a survey of the industry and determine the supply source. In all cases where Direct Contracting is contemplated, the survey must be conducted prior to the commencement of the procurement process. Moreover, the End-User must justify the necessity for an item that may only be procured through Direct Contracting, and it must be able to prove that there is no suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained at more advantageous terms. 2. Procedure a) The BAC shall prepare the RFQ or pro-forma invoice together with the terms and conditions of sale, and shall send the same to the identified direct supplier. b) Simplified negotiations on the terms and conditions of the contract may be conducted by the BAC to ensure that the supplier is technically, legally and financially capable to deliver the goods at the most advantageous price and contract for the Government. c) The BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the award of contract in favor of the supplier. Award of contract shall be made in accordance with Section IV(L) of this Guidelines. B. REPEAT ORDER16 15 Section 50, R.A. 9184 and its IRR. 16 Section 51, R.A. 9184 and its IRR. Page 120 of 149 1.

Repeat Order is a method of procurement of goods from the previous winning bidder, whenever there is a need to replenish goods subject to the following conditions: a) The goods were procured under a contract previously awarded through Competitive Bidding; b) Unit prices must be the same as or lower than those in the original contract, provided that such prices are still the most advantageous to the government after price verification; c) The repeat order will not result in splitting of contracts, requisitions, or purchase orders, as provided for in Article IV(B) of this Guidelines; d) Except in cases duly approved by the GPPB, repeat orders shall be availed of only within six (6) months from the date of the NTP arising from the original contract, provided that there has been a partial delivery, inspection and acceptance of the goods within the same period; e) Repeat orders shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the quantity of each item in the original contract. In order not to exceed the 25% threshold, the goods under the original contract must be: i. Quantifiable; ii. Divisible; and iii. Consisting of at least four (4) units per item. 2. Procedure a) Upon determination of the need to replenish the goods earlier procured through competitive bidding, the End-User unit shall prepare the necessary Purchase Request for the procurement of additional goods, after a careful study and confirmation of the prevailing market price of the goods to be re-ordered and comparing this with the price of the goods in the original contract, accompanied by the appropriate justification why the re-ordering is being pursued. b) When all the conditions are present, the BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the award of contract through Repeat Order. Award of contract shall be made in accordance with Section IV(L) of this Guidelines. C. SHOPPING17 1. Definition. Shopping is a method of procurement of goods whereby the Procuring Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily available off- the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment to be procured directly from suppliers of known qualifications.

The BAC shall open the financial proposal of each “passed” bidder and shall evaluate it using non-discretionary criteria - including arithmetical corrections for computational errors - as stated in the Bidding Documents, and thus determine the correct total calculated bid prices. The BAC shall automatically disqualify any total calculated bid price which exceeds the ABC. The total calculated bid prices (not exceeding the ABC) shall be ranked, in ascending order, from lowest to highest. The bid with the lowest total calculated bid price shall be identified as the Lowest Calculated Bid (LCB). 12. POST-QUALIFICATION and AWARD OF THE CONTRACT 12.1. The LCB shall be subject to post-qualification in accordance with Section 34, Rule X of this IRR to determine its responsiveness to the eligibility and bid requirements. If after post-qualification the Lowest Calculated Bid is determined to be post-qualified it shall be considered the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid (LCRB) and the contract shall be awarded to the bidder. In case of post-disqualification of the LCB, the procedure under Section 34 shall also be followed. 12.2. The Head of the Procuring Entity shall approve or disapprove the recommendations of the BAC within a period not exceeding fifteen (15) calendar days from the determination and declaration by the BAC of the LCRB. 12.3. The Head of the Procuring Entity concerned shall award the contract to the said bidder pursuant to the provisions of Section 37, Rule XI of this IRR. Page 112 of 149 13.

The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and applicability of all data, including the above, that it will use in its design and build proposal and services. The acquisition of right-of-way and the conduct of eminent domain proceedings shall still be the responsibility of the procuring entity, which shall include a preliminary budget for this purpose. 8. DETAILED ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS 8.1. Upon award of the design and build contract, the winning bidder shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of all necessary detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs in accordance with the provisions of Annex “A” of this IRR (with the exception of the Bidding Documents and the ABC). 8.2. The procuring entity shall ensure that all the necessary schedules with regard to the submission, confirmation and approval of the detailed engineering design and the details of the construction methods and procedures shall be included in the contract documents. 8.3. The procuring entity shall review, order rectification, and approve or disapprove – for implementation only - the submitted plans within these schedules. All instructions for rectification shall be in writing stating the reasons for such rectification. The design and build contractor shall be solely responsible for the integrity of the detailed engineering design and the performance of the structure irrespective of the approval/confirmation by the procuring entity. 9. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 9.1. The eligibility requirements for Design and Build infrastructure projects shall comply with the applicable provisions of Sections 23 to 24 of IRR. Page 109 of 149 9.2. A modified set of requirements integrating eligibility documents and criteria for infrastructure projects and consulting services shall be adopted, as follows: i. Class “A” Documents (Legal, Technical and Financial Documents) and Class “B” Documents The prospective bidder shall submit all the required Class “A” and Class “B” documents for infrastructure projects and the following: a) relevant statements of all on-going, completed, awarded but not yet started design/design and build related contracts, curriculum vitae of key staff, partners or principal officers; and b) valid licenses issued by the Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) for design professionals. (a) ii. Eligibility Criteria a) The eligibility of design and build contractors shall be based on the legal, technical and financial requirements abovementioned. In the technical requirements, the design and build contractor (as solo or in joint venture/consortia) should be able to comply with the experience requirement under the",en,1070
1396,PH_RA 9184 Government Procurement Act IRR 2016," 17.6 and Annex E. 2. PURPOSE These guidelines are formulated to determine the conditions for the use of the design and build scheme for infrastructure projects and the procedures for the implementation thereof. 3. GUIDING PRINCIPLES The procuring entity, prior to resorting to the design and build scheme, should consider the following advantages and disadvantages of said scheme: 3.1. Advantages: a) Since both design and construction are in the hands of the contractor, there is a single point of responsibility for quality, cost, and schedule adherence, including the risks related to design. This precludes buck- passing and finger-pointing between the designer and the builder. b) Because design and construction periods can overlap, the total design and construction time, as well as the final project cost, will be significantly reduced. c) The procuring entity is assured of quality considering that the larger responsibility implicit in the design-build scheme serves as motivation for high quality of the facility to be provided. Once the requirements of the procuring entity are defined in performance terms, the designer-builder is responsible for producing the results accordingly. The designer-builder warrants to the procuring entity that the design documents are complete and free from error. d) The procuring entity does not need to spend much time and money in seeing to it that the work is done by the contractor exactly as indicated by the design documents prepared by the designer, and in coordinating and arbitrating between separate design and construction contracts. 3.2. Disadvantages: a) Procuring Entities should, however, take into account that in utilizing the design and build scheme for a particular project, contractors are given too much discretion in determining the project cost and there is difficulty in predicting its final cost until the actual commencement of construction. Page 106 of 149 This, however, can be addressed by prescribing that the bid/contract price should not exceed the Approved Budget for Contract (ABC) of the procuring entity and that the contract price is a fixed lump sum amount. b) Considering that the extent of the integration of design and construction of the project is exceptionally dependent on the contractor, there may be cases when the end-result may not be exactly in accordance with what the procuring entity has required. These cases can be avoided if the procuring entity adequately defines the output or performance specifications and parameters. 4. DEFINITION OF TERMS a. Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC). This shall be a lump sum amount that shall cover the cost of design and construction works (at the option of the procuring entity) based on the conceptual design and performance specifications and in accordance with applicable provisions of the law or agency guidelines.

Under no circumstances shall a contractor proceed to commence work under any Change Order or Extra Work Order unless it has been approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative. 3.2. However, under any of the following conditions, the procuring entity’s representative/Project Engineer may, subject to the availability of funds and within the limits of his delegated authority, allow the immediate start of work under any Change Order or Extra Work Order: i) In the event of an emergency where the prosecution of the work is urgent to avoid detriment to public service, or damage to life and/or property; and/or ii) When time is of the essence; Provided, however, That such approval is valid on work done up to the point where the cumulative increase in value of work on the project which has not yet been duly fully approved does not exceed five percent (5%) of the adjusted original contract price; Provided, further, That immediately after the start of work, the corresponding Change Order or Extra Work Order shall be prepared and submitted for approval in accordance with the above rules herein set. Payments for works satisfactorily accomplished on any Change Order or Extra Work Order may be made only after approval of the same by the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative. Provided, finally, That for a Change Order or Extra Work Order involving a cumulative amount exceeding five percent (5%) of the original contract price, no work thereon may be commenced unless said Change Order or Extra Work Order has been approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative. 4. ADVANCE PAYMENT 4.1. The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the contractor which shall be submitted as a contract document, make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other relevant Tender Documents. 4.2. The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity. Page 98 of 149 4.3. The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a percentage equal to the percentage of the total contract price used for the advance payment. 4.4. The contractor may reduce his standby letter of credit or guarantee instrument by the amounts refunded by the Monthly Certificates in the advance payment. 5. PROGRESS PAYMENT 5.1. Once a month, the contractor may submit a statement of work accomplished (SWA) or progress billing and corresponding request for progress payment for work accomplished. The SWA should show the amounts which the contractor considers itself to be entitled to up to the end of the month, to cover (a) the cumulative value of the works it executed to date, based on the items in the Bill of Quantities, and (b) adjustments made for approved variation orders executed. 5.2. The procuring entity’s representative/project engineer shall check the contractor’s monthly SWA and certify the amount to be paid to the contractor as progress payment. Except as otherwise stipulated in the Instruction to Bidders, materials and equipment delivered on the site but not completely put in place shall not be included for payment. 5.3. The procuring entity shall deduct the following from the certified gross amounts to be paid to the contractor as progress payment: a) Cumulative value of the work previously certified and paid for. b) Portion of the advance payment to be recouped for the month. c) Retention money in accordance with the condition of contract. d) Amount to cover third party liabilities. e) Amount to cover uncorrected discovered defects in the works. 6. RETENTION MONEY 6.1. Progress payments are subject to retention of ten percent (10%) referred to as the ""retention money."" Such retention shall be based on the total amount due to the contractor prior to any deduction and shall be retained from every progress payment until fifty percent (50%) of the value of works, as determined by the procuring entity, are completed. If, after fifty percent (50%) completion, the work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no additional retention shall be made; otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall be imposed. 6.2. The total ""retention money"" shall be due for release upon final acceptance of the works. The contractor may, however, request the substitution of the retention money for each progress billing with irrevocable standby letters of credit of from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts equivalent to the retention money substituted for and acceptable to Government, provided that the project is on schedule and is satisfactorily undertaken. Otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall be made. Said irrevocable standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and/or surety bonds, to be posted in favor of the Government shall be valid for a duration to be determined by the concerned implementing office/agency or procuring entity and will answer for the purpose for which the ten percent (10%) retention is intended, i.e., to cover uncorrected discovered defects and third party liabilities. Page 99 of 149 7. CONTRACT COMPLETION Once the project reaches an accomplishment of ninety five (95%) of the total contract amount, the procuring entity may create an inspectorate team to make preliminary inspection and submit a punch-list to the contractor in preparation for the final turnover of the project. Said punch-list will contain, among others, the remaining works, work deficiencies for necessary corrections, and the specific duration/time to fully complete the project considering the approved remaining contract time. This, however, shall not preclude the procuring entity's claim for liquidated damages. 8. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 8.1. Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay. 8.2. A project or a portion thereof may be deemed usable when it starts to provide the desired benefits as certified by the targeted end-users and the concerned procuring entity. 8.3. To be entitled to such liquidated damages, the procuring entity does not have to prove that it has incurred actual damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due the contractor under the contract and/or collect such liquidated damages from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor whichever is convenient to the procuring entity. 8.4. In case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor's performance security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract. 8.5. In no case however, shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the contract shall automatically be taken over by the procuring entity concerned or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiation and the erring contractor's performance security shall be forfeited. The amount of the forfeited performance security shall be aside from the amount of the liquidated damages that the contractor shall pay the government under the provisions of this clause and impose other appropriate sanctions. 8.6. For terminated contracts where negotiation shall be undertaken, the procedures prescribed in the IRR shall be adopted. 9. SUSPENSION OF WORK 9.1. The procuring entity shall have the authority to suspend the work wholly or partly by written order for such period as may be deemed necessary, due to force majeure or any fortuitous events or for failure on the part of the contractor to correct bad conditions which are unsafe for workers or for the general public, to carry out valid orders given by the procuring entity or to perform any provisions of the contract, or Page 100 of 149 due to adjustment of plans to suit field conditions as found necessary during construction. The contractor shall immediately comply with such order to suspend the work wholly or partly. 9.2. The contractor or its duly authorized representative shall have the right to suspend work operation on any or all projects/activities along the critical path of activities after fifteen (15) calendar days from date of receipt of written notice from the contractor to the district engineer/regional director/consultant or equivalent official, as the case may be, due to the following: a. There exist right-of-way problems which prohibit the contractor from performing work in accordance with the approved construction schedule. b. Requisite construction plans which must be owner-furnished are not issued to the contractor precluding any work called for by such plans. c. Peace and order conditions make it extremely dangerous, if not possible, to work. However, this condition must be certified in writing by the Philippine National Police (PNP) station which has responsibility over the affected area and confirmed by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Regional Director. d. There is failure on the part of the procuring entity to deliver government-furnished materials and equipment as stipulated in the contract. e. Delay in the payment of contractor's claim for progress billing beyond forty-five (45) calendar days from the time the contractor's claim has been certified to by the procuring entity’s authorized representative that the documents are complete unless there are justifiable reasons thereof which shall be communicated in writing to the contractor. 9.3. In case of total suspension, or suspension of activities along the critical path, which is not due to any fault of the contractor, the elapsed time between the effective order of suspending operation and the order to resume work shall be allowed the contractor by adjusting the contract time accordingly. 10. EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME 10.1. Should the amount of additional work of any kind or other special circumstances of any kind whatsoever occur such as to fairly entitle the contractor to an extension of contract time, the procuring entity shall determine the amount of such extension; provided that the procuring entity is not bound to take into account any claim for an extension of time unless the contractor has, prior to the expiration of the contract time and within thirty (30) calendar days after such work has been commenced or after the circumstances leading to such claim have arisen, delivered to the procuring entity notices in order that it could have investigated them at that time. Failure to provide such notice shall constitute a waiver by the contractor of any claim. Upon receipt of full and detailed particulars, the procuring entity shall examine the facts and extent of the delay and shall extend the contract time completing the contract work when, in the procuring entity's opinion, the findings of facts justify an extension. Page 101 of 149 10.2. No extension of contract time shall be granted the contractor due to (a) ordinary unfavorable weather conditions and (b) inexcusable failure or negligence of contractor to provide the required equipment, supplies or materials. 10.3. Extension of contract time may be granted only when the affected activities fall within the critical path of the PERT/CPM network. 10.4. No extension of contract time shall be granted when the reason given to support the request for extension was already considered in the determination of the original contract time during the conduct of detailed engineering and in the preparation of the contract documents as agreed upon by the parties before contract perfection. 10.5. Extension of contract time shall be granted for rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site, based on the actual conditions obtained at the site, in excess of the number of rainy/unworkable days pre-determined by the government in relation to the original contract time during the conduct of detailed engineering and in the preparation of the contract documents as agreed upon by the parties before contract perfection, and/or for equivalent period of delay due to major calamities such as exceptionally destructive typhoons, floods and earthquakes, and epidemics, and for causes such as non-delivery on time of materials, working drawings, or written information to be furnished by the procuring entity, non- acquisition of permit to enter private properties within the right-of-way resulting in complete paralyzation of construction activities, and other meritorious causes as determined by the Government's authorized Engineer and approved by the procuring entity. Shortage of construction materials, general labor strikes, and peace and order problems that disrupt construction operations through no fault of the contractor may be considered as additional grounds for extension of contract time provided they are publicly felt and certified by appropriate government agencies such as DTI, DOLE,",en,2049
1406,PH_RA 9184 Government Procurement Act IRR 2016," INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 1. VARIATION ORDERS - CHANGE ORDER/EXTRA WORK ORDER 1.1. Variation Orders may be issued by the procuring entity to cover any increase/decrease in quantities, including the introduction of new work items that are not included in the original contract or reclassification of work items that are either due to change of plans, design or alignment to suit actual field conditions resulting in disparity between the preconstruction plans used for purposes of bidding and the ""as staked plans"" or construction drawings prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the Government after award of the contract, provided that the cumulative amount of the positive or additive Variation Order does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the original contract price. The addition/deletion of works under Variation Orders should be within the general scope of the project as bid and awarded. The scope of works shall not be reduced so as to accommodate a positive Variation Order. A Variation Order may either be in the form of either a change order or extra work order. 1.2. A Change Order may be issued by the implementing official to cover any increase/decrease in quantities of original work items in the contract. 1.3. An Extra Work Order may be issued by the implementing official to cover the introduction of new work necessary for the completion, improvement or protection of the project which was not included as items of work in the original contract, such as, where there are subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract, or where there are duly unknown physical conditions at the site of an unusual nature differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work or character provided for in the contract. 1.4. Any cumulative positive Variation Order beyond ten percent (10%) of the original contract price shall be subject of another contract to be bid out if the works are separable from the original contract. In exceptional cases where it is urgently necessary to complete the original scope of work, the Head of the Procuring Entity may authorize a positive variation order that will make the cumulative value of the positive Variation Orders go beyond ten percent (10%) but not more than twenty percent (20%) of the original contract price, subject to the guidelines to be determined by the GPPB: Provided, however, That appropriate sanctions shall be imposed on the designer, consultant or official responsible for the original detailed engineering design which failed to consider the Variation Order beyond ten percent (10%). 1.5. In claiming for any Variation Order, the contractor shall, within seven (7) calendar days after such work has been commenced pursuant to Item 3.2 hereof; or, within twenty eight (28) calendar days after the circumstances or reasons justifying a claim for extra cost shall have occurred, deliver a notice giving full and detailed particulars of any extra cost in order that it may be investigated at that time. Failure to provide either of such notices in the time stipulated shall constitute a waiver by the contractor for any claim. The preparation and submission of Variation Orders are as follows: Page 96 of 149 a) If the procuring entity’s representative/Project Engineer believes that a Change Order or Extra Work Order should be issued, he shall prepare the proposed Order accompanied with the notices submitted by the contractor, the plans therefore, his computations as to the quantities of the additional works involved per item indicating the specific stations where such works are needed, the date of his inspections and investigations thereon, and the log book thereof, and a detailed estimate of the unit cost of such items of work, together with his justifications for the need of such Change Order or Extra Work Order, and shall submit the same to the Head of the Procuring Entity for approval. b) The Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative upon receipt of the proposed Change Order or Extra Work Order shall immediately instruct the appropriate technical staff or office of the procuring entity to conduct an on-the-spot investigation to verify the need for the work to be prosecuted and to review the proposed plan, and prices of the work involved. c) The technical staff of appropriate office of the procuring entity shall submit a report of their findings and recommendations, together with the supporting documents, to the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative for consideration. d) The Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative, acting upon the recommendation of the technical staff or appropriate office, shall approve the Change Order or Extra Work Order after being satisfied that the same is justified, necessary, and in order. e) The timeframe for the processing of Variation Orders from the preparation up to the approval by the procuring entity concerned shall not exceed thirty (30) calendar days. 2. ADDITIONAL/EXTRA WORK COSTING 2.1. For Variation Orders, the contractor shall be paid for additional work items whose unit prices shall be derived based on the following: a. For additional/extra works duly covered by Change Orders involving work items which are exactly the same or similar to those in the original contract, the applicable unit prices of work items original contract shall be used. b. For additional/extra works duly covered by Extra Work Orders involving new work items that are not in the original contract, the unit prices of the new work items shall be based on the direct unit costs used in the original contract (e.g., unit cost of cement, rebars, form lumber, labor rate, equipment rental, etc.). All new components of the new work item shall be fixed prices, provided the same is acceptable to both the Government and the contractor, and provided further that the direct unit costs of new components shall be based on the contractor's estimate as validated by the procuring entity concerned via documented canvass in accordance with existing rules and regulations. The direct cost of the new work item shall then be combined with the mark-up factor (i.e., taxes and profit) used by the contractor in his bid to determine the unit price of the new work item. Page 97 of 149 2.2. Request for payment by the contractor for any extra work shall be accompanied by a statement, with the approved supporting forms, giving a detailed accounting and record of amount for which he claims payment. Said request for payment shall be included with the contractor's statement for progress payment. 3. CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CONTRACTOR IS TO START WORK UNDER",en,1009

Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient to the procuring entity concerned. In no case shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated damages to be paid. 4. Advance Payment 4.1. In accordance with Presidential Decree 1445, advance payment shall be made only after prior approval of the President, and shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the President; Provided, however, that for cases mentioned under 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 of these guidelines, no prior approval by the President shall be necessary. 4.2.

1425,PH_RA 9184 Government Procurement Act IRR 2016," PRINCIPLES ON CONSULTING SERVICES 1. Definition A natural or juridical person, qualified by appropriate education, training and relevant experience to render any or all of the types and fields of consulting services as defined in this IRR, shall be considered as a “Consultant,” subject to the requirements provided in this IRR for eligibility check and post-qualification. 2. The Need for Consultants The services of consultants may be engaged by any procuring entity for government projects or related activities of such magnitude and/or scope as would require a level of expertise or attention beyond the optimum in-house capability of the procuring entity concerned and consistent with the Government’s policy not to compete with the private sector. 3. Independence of Consultants To ensure the consultant’s professional independence, integrity, and objectivity, consultants, as well as key staff working for the consulting entity, who may be directly or indirectly associated with non-consulting firms that may have an interest in or bias towards the project concerned, shall be selected only if they agree to limit their role to that of consultants and will disqualify themselves and their affiliates for bidding for products and services of the same government project. 4. Hiring of Consultants 4.1. Consultants shall be hired on the basis of their proven expertise, experience and capability. Under certain conditions provided herein, cost may be included as a factor in the selection of consultants. 4.2. In order to manifest trust and confidence in and promote the development of Filipino consultancy, Filipino consultants shall be hired whenever the services required for the project are within the expertise and capability of Filipino consultants: Provided, however, That in the event Filipino consultants do not have the sufficient expertise and capability to render the services required under the project, as determined by the Head of the Procuring Entity, foreign consultants may be hired. 4.3. In the hiring of foreign consultants, all pertinent laws and regulations of the Philippines shall be followed. 4.4. Technology and knowledge transfer to the procuring entity shall be required in the provision of consulting services, where applicable. Page 85 of 149 5. Organization of Consultants 5.1. The umbrella organization of consultants recognized by the Government shall be composed of the various organizations of consultants that may be engaged by the Government under this IRR and shall accredit its members on the types of services and fields of professions where the members are technically and financially qualified to offer their services. The umbrella organization shall prepare and certify a list of fields and expertise in such fields available with the names of the accredited local consultants which shall be updated annually or as often as necessary and disseminate such list to concerned agencies of the Government. It shall likewise regulate its members for the development of the industry. The Government may consult and deal with this umbrella organization on matters relating to the industry. The GPPB shall be the appropriate government body that shall recognize the consultants’ umbrella organization. 5.2. The umbrella organization may submit its files of accredited consultants to the BAC of the procuring entity in accordance with the form prescribed by the BAC which can serve as registration of the consultants under the next succeeding Subsection: Provided, however, That each such accredited consultant shall comply with the eligibility requirements provided in this IRR. Such qualification statements, together with the list of accredited consultants prepared in accordance with the immediately preceding section, shall guide the BAC in determining the fields where Filipino consultants are already qualified and capable and where foreign consultants may not be required. 6. Types of Consulting Services The services to be provided by consultants can be divided into six (6) broad categories, namely: (a) advisory and review services; (b) pre-investment or feasibility studies; (c) design; (d) construction supervision; (e) management and related services; and (f) other technical services or special studies. 6.1. Advisory and Review Services. These services include advice on particular projects or problems. These will include advice on and review of, among others, planning, design and other professional services, as well as management, production, inspection, testing and quality control. They also include such services as appearances before commissions, boards or other judicial bodies to give evidence or otherwise submit professional opinions. 6.2. Pre-Investment or Feasibility Studies. These are the studies which normally precede decisions to go (or not to go) forward with specific projects. These studies may have as their objectives: a) To establish investment priorities and sector policies - Studies for this objective include, among others, basic resource inventories, such as, river basin surveys, transport sector surveys, and studies of alternative development patterns and of sectors on a regional or nationwide scale. b) To determine the basic features and the feasibility of individual projects - Studies for this objective include, among others, the functional design, project site selection, architectural and space programming and physical layout of specific projects, preliminary design and cost estimates, and the economic, financial and environmental impact analyses required for project evaluation. Page 86 of 149 c) To define and propose changes in governmental policies, operations and institutions necessary for the successful implementation or functioning of investment projects - Studies for this objective include, among others, analysis of project related organizations, administrative problems, planning machinery, regulatory and marketing policies, accounting, and management systems, manpower resources and training requirements. 6.3. Design. This type of services normally consists of three (3) phases: a) Pre-Design Phase – establishes the general size and scope of the project and its location on the site. The services include but are not limited to reconnaissance, topographical and other engineering and land surveys, soils investigations, preparation of preliminary architectural/engineering designs, layouts, outline specifications, preliminary cost estimates and specific recommendations prior to actual design; b) Basic Design Phase – includes the preparation of detailed plans, designs, working drawings, specifications, detailed cost estimates and tender documents required for invitations of bids for construction works and equipment; and c) Support Services During Construction – includes assistance and advice in securing bids, tabulation and analysis of bid results, and making recommendations on the award of construction contracts, and in preparing formal contract documents; preparation of supplementary drawings required to suit actual field conditions; checking detailed construction and as-built drawings, shop and erection drawings submitted by contractors; making periodic visits to check on the general progress of work and quality of materials and workmanship; observing performance tests and start-up and making report thereon; and making a final inspection and reporting of completed project. 6.4. Construction Supervision.

1426,PH_RA 9184 Government Procurement Act IRR 2016," PROJECTS 1. Detailed engineering shall proceed only on the basis of the feasibility or preliminary engineering study made which establishes the technical viability of the project and conformance to land use and zoning guidelines prescribed by existing laws. The findings contained in the feasibility study, if undertaken for the project, shall be examined. If, in the course of this exercise, it is found that changes would be desirable in the design standards of principal features, as proposed, specific recommendations for such changes shall be supported by detailed justifications, including their effects on the cost, and (if necessary) the economic justification. 2. A schedule of detailed engineering activities shall include the following: a) Survey b) Site Investigation c) Soils and Foundation Investigation d) Construction Materials Investigation e) Preparation of Design Plans f) Preparation of Technical Specifications g) Preparation of Quantity and Cost Estimates h) Preparation of Program of Work i) Preparation of Proposed Construction Schedule (and estimated Cash Flow for projects with Schedule over Six (6) Months) j) Preparation of Site or Right-of-Way Plans including Schedule of Acquisition k) Preparation of Utility Relocation Plan l) Preparation and Submission of Design Report m) Environmental Impact Statement for critical project as defined by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) n) Preparation of minimum requirements for a Construction Safety and Health Program for the project being considered o) Value Engineering Studies p) Preparation of Bid/Tender Documents (a) 3. Work under detailed engineering shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: a) Design Standards – Design standards shall be in accordance with appropriate standards and accepted detailed engineering practice adopted by the agency concerned. Design standards for structures shall take into account, among other things, the seismicity of the area to determine the optimum safety of structures and to minimize possible earthquake damage. b) Field Surveys And Investigations – Necessary field surveys and investigations which may include aerial, hydrographic, topographic, hydrologic, sub-surface, monumenting and other surveys shall be carried out in accordance with the design guidelines, criteria and standards adopted by the agency concerned. All survey and investigation works shall be prepared in a manner satisfactory to carry out accurate design and production of plans that will permit quantity estimates to be made within plus or minus ten percent (10%) of the final quantities of the completed structure. Page 81 of 149 c) Contract Plans – The following plans shall be prepared for each construction contract in accordance with guidelines and standards adopted by the procuring entity concerned, incorporating at least the following: i) Site development plan ii) Plans and profile sheet iii) Typical sections and details iv) Drainage details where applicable v) Structural plans at appropriate scales indicating all details necessary in order that the complete structure can be set out and constructed vi) Other details which may be required by the head of the agency d) Quantities – All construction quantities shall be computed to a reasonable accuracy of not more than plus or minus ten percent (10%) of the final quantities of the as-built structure. e) Special Provisions – Specifications shall be prepared for specific terms of work or methods of construction, measurement and payment under each contract, which are not covered by Standard Construction and Material Specifications adopted by the procuring entity concerned. f) Unit Prices – These shall be prepared for each contract using costs based on reasonable approved current prices as projected over the proposed construction period, divided into local and foreign exchange costs, as the case may be. g) Approved Budget for the Contract – the ABC to be bid shall be prepared by official(s) duly designated by the Head of the Procuring Entity concerned or by his duly authorized official. It shall be approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly designated official. Since the contracts are fixed price contracts, the ABC to be bid shall provide for the projected movements of construction costs over the construction period considering the projected inflation and foreign exchange rates as issued by the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC). It shall also show the local and foreign currency requirements, as the case may be. The ABC to be bid shall specify for each major work item, such as earthwork, roadwork, and massive concreting, the components for equipment rentals, fuel, labor, materials and overhead, including the cost of the approved construction safety and health program and warranty premium. h) Bidding Documents – These shall be prepared as provided for in the IRR. i) Program of Work – Before prosecuting any project, the necessary program of work shall be prepared and submitted for approval. In no case shall construction funds be remitted to field offices or construction work on a project be started before the program of work is approved, in accordance with existing laws. No program of work for any project shall be approved without detailed engineering. The program of work shall include, among other things, estimates of the work, items, quantities and costs and a PERT/CPM network of the project activities. The program of work shall cover at least a usable portion of the project and no Page 82 of 149 construction shall be started for portions of the project that are less than usable, except projects requiring stage construction, in which case continuity of construction up to the completion of a usable portion must be assured. j) Contract Time or Duration – In the preparation of the Bidding Documents, the agency shall make an estimate of the actual number of working days required to complete the project through PERT/CPM analysis of the project activities and corrected for holidays and weekends. Likewise, the agency shall make an estimate of the number of rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site, based on the records of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and incorporate the same in the corrected actual number of working days determined above, which shall be made the basis of the total contract time. The estimated number of rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site shall be made known before the date of bidding through the Instructions to Bidders for the purpose of guiding the contractor in preparing his bid and as reference to both the GOP and winning contractors taking action on the requests for time extensions. Without the estimated number of rainy/unworkable days established before the bidding date and made known to all participating bidders, the contract time is presumed to have excluded the unfavorable conditions. k) Warranty Period – Likewise, the Bidding Documents shall specify the type of project and the corresponding warranty period required by the procuring entity. l) Value Engineering – For major projects as specified by the agency, value engineering shall be conducted according to accepted standards and practices. Value engineering shall analyze alternative schemes of achieving the projects objectives in order to delete or reduce non-essential features and lessen the life cycle costs of the projects without sacrificing the quality and integrity of the structure, while maintaining its essential function, performance, and safety. m) Site or Right-of-Way Acquisition Plans and Resettlement Action Plans – These shall be prepared based on parcellary surveys and socio-economic surveys of households affected by the project. 4. For projects to be implemented by phases, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that there is a clear delineation of work for each phase, which must be usable, and structurally sound. It shall also ensure the conduct of the detailed engineering activities for each phase as provided for in Item 2 of this Guidelines. (n) 5. As a requirement for the procurement of infrastructure works, the concerned consultants/government officials who prepared and approved the detailed engineering shall issue a certification that the detailed engineering surveys and designs have been conducted according to the prescribed agency standards and specifications in conformance with the provisions of this Annex, and that the detailed engineering outputs are adequate for the procurement at hand. The approval by the authorized government officials of detailed engineering surveys and designs undertaken by consultants neither diminishes the responsibility of the latter for the technical integrity of the surveys and designs nor transfer any part of that responsibility to the approving officials. 6. The above rules shall apply to the implementation of infrastructure projects under normal or ordinary conditions. However, under emergency or extraordinary cases Page 83 of 149 involving major calamities and disasters as declared by the President where time is of the essence to save lives and properties and restore damaged infrastructures, detailed engineering works shall be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and procedures, as prescribed by the head of the appropriate infrastructure agency and approved by the Infrastructure Committee of the National Economic and Development Authority Board, to enable quick response to said cases, while maintaining the safety and integrity of the structure.

(a) 47.2. All bidders also found to have conflicting interests with each other shall be disqualified to participate in the procurement at hand, without prejudice to the imposition of appropriate administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. A bidder may be considered to have conflicting interests with another bidder in any of the events described in paragraphs (a) through (c) below and a general conflict of interest in any of the circumstances set out in paragraphs (d) through (j) below: a) A bidder has controlling shareholders in common with another bidder; b) A bidder receives or has received any direct or indirect subsidy from any other bidder; c) A bidder has the same legal representative as that of another bidder for purposes of this bid; d) A bidder has a relationship, directly or through third parties, that puts them in a position to have access to information about or influence on the bid of another bidder or influence the decisions of the Procuring Entity regarding this bidding process. This will include a firm or an organization who lends, or temporarily seconds, its personnel to firms or organizations which are engaged in consulting services for the preparation related to procurement for or implementation of the project if the personnel would be involved in any capacity on the same project; e) A bidder submits more than one bid in this bidding process. However, this does not limit the participation of subcontractors in more than one bid; f) A bidder who participated as a consultant in the preparation of the design or technical specifications of the Goods and related services that are the subject of the bid; g) A bidder who lends, or temporarily seconds, its personnel to firms or organizations which are engaged in consulting services for the preparation related to procurement for or implementation of the project, if the personnel would be involved in any capacity on the same project; h) If a consultant combines the function of consulting with those of contracting and/or supply of equipment; i) If a consultant is associated with, affiliated to, or owned by a contractor or a manufacturing firm with departments or design offices offering services as Page 59 of 149 consultants unless such consultant includes relevant information on such relationships along with a statement in the technical proposal cover letter to the effect that the consultant shall limit its role to that of a consultant and disqualify itself and its associates from work in any other capacity that may emerge from the project (including bidding for any part of the future project). The contract with the consultant selected to undertake the project shall contain an appropriate provision to such effect; or j) If there is a conflict among consulting projects, the consultant (including its personnel and subcontractors) and any subsidiaries or entities controlled by such consultant shall not be recruited for the relevant project. The duties of the consultant depend on the circumstances of each case. While continuity of consulting services may be appropriate in particular situations where no conflict exists, a consultant cannot be recruited to carry out a project that, by its nature, shall result in conflict with a prior or current project of such consultant. Examples of the situations mentioned are when a consultant engaged to prepare engineering design for an infrastructure project shall not be recruited to prepare an independent environmental assessment for the same project; similarly, a consultant assisting a Procuring Entity in privatization of public assets shall not purchase, nor advise purchasers, of such assets; or a consultant hired to prepare terms of reference for a project shall not be recruited for the project in question.

For the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects, the BAC shall evaluate the financial component of the bids to determine the Lowest Calculated Bid using the following steps: 32.2.1. The BAC shall immediately conduct a detailed evaluation of all bids using non- discretionary criteria in considering the following: a) Completeness of the bid. Unless the Instructions to Bidders specifically allow partial bids, bids not addressing or providing all of the required items in the Bidding Documents including, where applicable, bill of quantities, shall be considered non-responsive and, thus, automatically disqualified. In this regard, where a required item is provided, but no price is indicated, the same shall be considered as non-responsive, but specifying a zero (0) or a dash (-) for the said item would mean that it is being offered for free to the Government, except those required by law or regulations to be provided for; and b) Arithmetical corrections. Consider computational errors and omissions to enable proper comparison of all eligible bids. It may also consider bid modifications if expressly allowed in the Bidding Documents. Any adjustment shall be calculated in monetary terms to determine the calculated prices. (a) 32.2.2. The BAC shall evaluate all bids on an equal footing to ensure fair and competitive bid comparison. For this purpose, all bidders shall be required to include the cost of all taxes, such as, but not limited to, value added tax (VAT), income tax, local taxes, and other fiscal levies and duties which shall be itemized in the bid form and reflected in the detailed estimates. Such bids, including said taxes, shall be the basis for bid evaluation and comparison. 32.2.3. In case of discrepancies between: (a) bid prices in figures and in words, the latter shall prevail; (b) total price per item and unit price for the item as extended or multiplied by the quantity of that item, the latter shall prevail; (c) stated total price and the actual sum of prices of component items, the latter shall prevail; (d) unit cost in the detailed estimate and unit cost in the bill of quantities, the latter shall prevail. 32.2.4. Bids shall then be ranked in the ascending order of their total calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for computational errors, and other bid modifications, to identify the Lowest Calculated Bid.

There shall be no lower limit or floor on the amount of the award. 31.2. For Foreign-funded Procurement, the ABC shall be applied as the ceiling: Provided, That the following conditions are met: a) Bidding Documents are obtainable free of charge on a freely accessible website. If payment of Bidding Documents is required by the Procuring Entity, payment could be made upon the submission of bids. b) The Procuring Entity has procedures in place to ensure that the ABC is based on recent estimates made by the engineer or the responsible unit of the Procuring Entity and that the estimates are based on adequate detailed engineering (in the case of Infrastructure Projects) and reflect the quality, supervision and risk and inflationary factors, as well as prevailing market prices, associated with the types of Goods or Infrastructure Projects to be procured. c) The Procuring Entity has trained cost estimators on estimating prices and analyzing bid variances. In the case of Infrastructure Projects, the Procuring Entity must also have trained quantity surveyors. d) The Procuring Entity has established a system to monitor and report bid prices relative to ABC and engineer’s/Procuring Entity’s estimate. e) The Procuring Entity has established a monitoring and evaluation system for contract implementation to provide a feedback on actual total costs of Goods and Infrastructure Projects.

The BAC shall open the first bid envelopes in public to determine each bidder’s compliance with the documents required to be submitted for eligibility and for the technical requirements, as prescribed in this IRR. For this purpose, the BAC shall check the submitted documents of each bidder against a checklist of required documents to ascertain if they are all present, using a non-discretionary “pass/fail” criterion, as stated in the Instructions to Bidders. If a bidder submits the required document, it shall be rated “passed” for that particular requirement. In this regard, bids that fail to include any requirement or are incomplete or patently insufficient shall be considered as “failed.” Otherwise, the BAC shall rate the said first bid envelope as “passed.” (a) 30.2. Immediately after determining compliance with the requirements in the first envelope, the BAC shall forthwith open the second bid envelope of each remaining eligible bidder whose first bid envelope was rated “passed.” The second envelope of each complying bidder shall be opened within the same day, except as provided under Section 33 of this IRR. In case any of the requirements in the second envelope of a particular bid is missing, incomplete or patently insufficient, and/or if the submitted total bid price exceeds the ABC, the BAC shall rate the bid concerned as “failed.” Only bids that are determined to contain all the bid requirements for both components shall be rated “passed” and shall immediately be considered for evaluation and comparison. (a) 30.3. For the procurement of Goods where, due to the nature of the requirements of the project, the required technical specifications/requirements of the contract cannot be precisely defined in advance of bidding, or where the problem of technically unequal bids is likely to occur, a two (2)-stage bidding procedure may be employed. In these cases, the Procuring Entity concerned shall prepare the Bidding Documents, including the technical specification in the form of performance criteria only. Under this procedure, prospective bidders shall be requested at the first stage to submit their respective eligibility requirements if needed, and initial technical proposals only (no price tenders). The concerned BAC shall then evaluate the technical merits of the proposals received from eligible bidders vis-à-vis the required performance standards. A meeting/discussion shall then be held by the BAC with those eligible bidders whose technical tenders meet the minimum required standards stipulated in the Bidding Documents for purposes of drawing up the final revised technical specifications/requirements of the contract. Once the final revised technical Page 42 of 149 specifications are completed and duly approved by the concerned BAC, copies of the same shall be issued to all the bidders identified in the first stage who shall then be required to submit their revised technical tenders, including their price proposals in two (2) separate sealed envelopes in accordance with this IRR, at a specified deadline, after which time no more bids shall be received.

(2) A party not affected or prejudiced cannot file an opposition. (3) One public service corporation cannot assume the name and be substituted in the place of another public service corporation. (4) A legal representative of the estate of a deceased applicant may be substituted for the latter. If the right consists in the prosecution of unfinished proceedings upon an application for a certificate of public convenience of the deceased before the Public service Commission, it is but logical that the legal representative be empowered and entitled in behalf of the estate to make the right effective in that proceeding. (5) One who has been granted a legislative franchise to operate an ice plant, although not yet an operator of such public utility, has sufficient interest or personality either to oppose an established operator's application for an increase in the capacity of his existing plant, or to ask for a joint hearing of said application and the grantee's own application for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience in order to operate under such franchise. (6) The fact that a party is the lessee of a line does not bar him from applying for a certificate of its own in the same line. Even in cases where the owner of a certificate has sold it subject to the condition that he would not apply for a similar service on the same line sold by him, it has been held that such an argument does not bar the seller from applying and that the Public Service Commission, if it finds that there is public need for the new service applied for, may properly grant the certificate requested. In other words the primary consideration is a finding by the Commission that public interest and convenience require a given service and that parties may not by agreement deprive the Commission of its power. (7) A case involving the grant of a Certificate of Public Convenience to the respondent becomes moot and academic where the respondent ceases to be a bus operator, and it should be dismissed. https://lawphil.net/statutes/comacts/ca_146_1936.html Page 10 of 15 C.A.
